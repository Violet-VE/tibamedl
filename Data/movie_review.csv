0,rambofan4life,"Iron Man is the best bad-ass action MCU movie definitely my favorite in the MARVEL comic book films. It has a great story great origin story about Tony Stark 8rober Downey Jr.) how he become armored avenger ""Iron Man"". The movie has high-flying action sequence and super speed. Iron man was build and not born. Excellent performance from Robert Downey Jr. as playboy billionaire Tony Stark/Iron Man. The first movie in the trilogy is the best one it is my favorite MCU film it is also intelligent and interesting. How from an selfish, arrogant prick turns in to a good heart person who want to do the right thing to protect innocent and destroy the weapons his designed that fall in to terrorists hands. It begins in Afghanistan on a tour Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is captured by an enemy terrorist and is forced with Yinsen (Shaun Toub) is forced by terrorist known as ""Ten Rings"" to build in a cave Jericho missile who designed for American military that is his price for a freedom but Tony knows they want let him free so instead he builds an powered armor suit in their escape. But his friend Yinsen during the escape dies. In a battle of fire fight Tony Escapes and try's to destroy the rest of weapons. After returning home Tony Stark industrialist shut's down the factory of weapons and starts building high-tech suit of armor red and yellow color and vows to protect the world from treats as ""Iron man"". Tony finds out that he was betrayed by his friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who hired Tony's hit and Obadiah was the one who was selling weapons to the terrorist group. Iron Man must not only to protect our world he has to fight Iron Mongler on the end of the film in a suit that is Obadiah Stane. He goes back in to Afghanistan and destroys all his weapons and he defends the weakest people. He also has a blue heart in the chest because the shrapnel hits him.The film has great direction from Jon Favreau who also plays Happy Hogan Tony Stark's personal bodyguard. The music score for the first Iron Man is excellent from Ramin Djawadi who also made an excellent music for Prison Break TV Series. Great performance from Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts Tony's secretary and assistant I enjoy her performance. Terrence Howard is great and likeable as James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes he was better as Don Cheadle. Paul Bettany as JARVIS voice was excellent I love hearing JARVIS advices to Tony. Jeff Bridges was super fantastic bad-guy as Obadiah Stane/Iron Mongler. Great action film and great action sequences watch in which Iron Man battles Iron Mongler best epic sequences ever. I love how Tony Stark redeem him self for his selfishness and decide to make his world a better place. Tony Stark as Iron Man is my favorite MARVEL superhero. Captain America is my number 1 superhero and Iron Man is my second superhero. I was hooked on this film for years I still I am. Great film, great flying sequences I love the suit for Iron Man that was designed. I was researching about his suit if someone could build it in real life an armor suit as Tony did and you would probably need hundred millions $ to build a suit like that. This film is straight from the comic books they didn't change anything new about the film, maybe the names I am not a comic book fan of Iron Man. I have this movie on DVD and Blu-ray and I have watch the DVD many times. Actually I am been a fan of Iron Man my whole life after seeing him in animated series and animated movies. I was such a huge fan of this movie that I want it to buy in the store DVD but I found only animated movie not this movie. After this film was released I become so excited about seen this film and I never expect how good it would turn too. Everyone from the cast at acting did an excellent 100% of them. It is an 10 year anniversary since this action masterpiece come out. Yes I am calling it a masterpiece cause I love it so much. The writing work so well with the actors with their roles. There's a lot of development into the writing and made relate to the comics. But of course the main that people loved this film is Robert Downey Jr. He killed it as Tony Stark and Iron Man. I couldn't see any other actor to take the role. He brings so much development and emotions into Tony and make you relate to him real easy. This movie get's 10 a perfect score is my favorite origin MARVEL superhero movie off all time the best one in the trilogy. From the special effects of the design. You have soundtrack AC/DC in this film ""Back In Black"" so the film isn't praised only for CGI, action sequences and acting it is praised for AC/DC soundtrack. The band is so popular that director Jon Favreau hired the band AC/DC for the sequel Iron Man 2. The film has tow sequels Iron Man 2 and Iron Man Three not a big fan of those two movies but I enjoy the third film the second one I don't.",29 September 2018," ""I am Iron Man"" - The greatest origin of a superhero begins the best one in the ""Iron Man"" trilogy

1,sacflyzone,"Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2008, quite possibly the number one film.",23 April 2008," Delivers Intelligence & Great Acting with its Fun

2,ffiisshh,"WOW WOW WOW.This is the movie I have been waiting for for a very long time. I am an avid Ironman reader. I have collected the comics all my life (from #1 in 1968 to the latest in 2008)...40 years of Ironman. Since I was a kid, I used to say to my friends that they should make an Ironman movie, but everyone laughed and said that the special effects would look ridiculous...mind you, that was back in like in the early 1980's. But, now we are in the age of CGI, and what an age it is. Just for you Ironman fans, to see him come to life with such spectacular graphics is reason enough to spend your hard-earned $10. The plot is also pretty well thought out, and the acting is just fine. What better pick could you have for Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.? (just wait for the sequels when they can delve into his alcoholism...Mr. Downey has been there and beyond...that's probably why they chose him for the role...fore-thought)The rest of the cast is right on par, as well. The pace is brisk, and the whole thing works as a great addition to the Marvel Universe in the Cinema!! Enjoy!",21 April 2008," Wow, very impressive !!!!

It's well-written and has a great cast.What impressed me the most was the CGI!

4,DICK STEEL,"With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There's something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.This may irk the fervent fans of Iron Man, but face it, the superhero belonged to Tier B where superheroes are concerned, languishing behind easily recognizable peers who already have movie after movie being made. But thanks to the advancement in digital technology, bringing Iron Man to life no longer consisted of the prospect and worrying thought of having a man running about in a rubber suit passing it off as metal, the way Ultraman would have been done, complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and fool the visual sensory. Here, we have a very detailed rendering of the entire design from scratch to final modification, and we're in at every step of the way, with many cheeky and sometimes a tad implausible scenes just for cheap laughs thrown in.I thought Iron Man the story worked because of stark (pardon the pun) similarities with Batman Begins, also an origin story which took its time to dwell on the man behind the suit, nevermind at the sacrifice of having less action sequences, or by not giving the fans what they want through the showcase of more than the basic powers. Advanced capabilities can always find room in the sequel, and as the first movie used to establish its characters, I felt that it succeeded, given too that it had a cast of capables (just like Batman Begins had) to pull the movie through without resorting to over the top and campy performances, starting of course with the lead in Robert Downey Jr.In a nutshell, Downey is Tony Stark through and through. His affinity for the character shines, and no doubt it bore some parallels between his own personal, and Stark's life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle. He was allowed to become a Two-Face of sorts, on one hand being and later acting out his flamboyance self whose mission in life was the continuation of his father's legacy of Stark Industries, a weapons conglomerate, versus his personal mission in ridding his own weapons from the hands of the bad guys, now updated to be freedom fighters in the Middle East. The dialogue contained within each scene of Stark's, except perhaps during captivity, is full of one-liners done in double quick time, you probably would think it boiled down to a whole host of natural ad-libbing.But while Starks spends significant amount of time in his unsecured basement building his masterpiece, his human interaction come in the form of faithful secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who actually, for the first time I admit, looked really good on screen as Stark's most trusted aide, bringing about some serious spark of sexual tension and chemistry between the two characters of opposite sex, more so than any other comic book movie I have seen. And good friend from the air force Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) complete the circle of trust who knows of Stark's secret identity, and you'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the toss of a teaser of a certain War Machine appearance should the sequel be out. Who's the main villain in the movie? It points the finger at Corporations, or at least here, the weapons manufacturers and the shady deals that go through in the name of profit, the sole objective for any corporation's existence. And Jeff Bridges, in a rare villainous role, got to personify that greed and wrestle for absolute power just like the trailer already suggested. While his performance is refreshing as he disappears behind the ball head and bushy beard, you could see his motivation and how the plot would have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for Iron Man to duke it out in a, sad to say, ordinary finale which any audience would probably be able to stay a step ahead.As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of similarities with the Dark Knight of Gotham in Christopher Nolan's reboot, but more so because of properties inherent with the likeness between Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark. Both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day job to pursue their ""hobby"", both have to suffer personal tragedies in order to wake up to the cruel world, and in the movie, both fall prey to the corporate raider type, spend time perfecting their suit of war, have assistants they would trust their lives with, and of course save them from impending doom, and a finales set at their facilities.But Iron Man is still a special effects extravaganza offering a thrill ride especially when he goes into battle mode, and without a doubt, Robert Downey Jr probably should be credited for raising the profile of this once Tier-B character, to perhaps becoming more recognizable now, and obviously, expanding the fan base of this weaponry filled suit of metal, which of course, in this origin movie, we were only given a glimpse of its potential. can everyone now spell sequel and clamour for more please? Iron Man has set the bar for the other upcoming comic book movies to try and surpass this summer season!",30 April 2008," A Nutshell Review: Iron Man

5,Chrysanthepop,"Until May 2008, the few releases this year that I've seen ranged from below average to downright rubbish with the exception of two movies. One being 'Iron Man'. This is the movie we have been waiting for this year. So does it match up to expectations? Hell yes! On the surface, 'Iron Man' isn't very different from other superhero films but on the other hand it isn't like any other superhero movie. This one has rich characters, it perfectly blends humour, drama, action and it has heart, all of which are presented on screen in a wonderful way that keeps the viewer staring at the screen right till the end. The writing is great as 'Iron Man' sticks to the main story all the way. I liked how Downey Jr's Tony Stark grows from this carefree business-minded tech-tycoon who's only concern is Stark Industries to a man with a mission to save the world and in the process he still stays the same person as he maintains his sense of humour, his courage and his integrity. The dialogues, especially Starks's one-liners are sharp, witty and funny. This movie is an introduction to the famous title character thus those expecting only action from start to end (like 'Transformers') may be disappointed to an extent. But for me there was enough action along with substance to make it a hugely enjoyable experience.Jon Favreau is proving to be a more versatile director and his impressive filmography, both as actor and director, prove that he's experimented with different kinds of cinema. 'Iron Man' wouldn't have been an easy film to direct but Favreau does a magnificent job. The CGI is excellent as I loved how much attention was given to detail and how the viewer is shown every step of the making of Iron Man. Of course, there's some humour added to lighten up the mood instead of technologically overloading the viewers.'Iron Man' is just the movie that Robert Downey Jr. needed and it couldn't have come at a better time. At a time, when this talented actor's performances were hardly getting enough notice, 'Iron Man' brings him back to recognition. After seeing him, one would conclude that the part was made only for Downey Jr. His dialogue delivery seems so natural that it would be hard to tell whether he was acting, if the scenes were taken out of context. I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow has ever looked better. Though the role does not allow her to really stretch her acting, Potts isn't just a typical superhero's dame. She is Tony's confidant and the one who supports him through thick and thin. Paltrow provides the necessary charisma, sex appeal and soul that makes Pepper Potts shine and she shares a sizzling chemistry with her male lead. Terrence Howard has a smaller role as Tony's good friend but there's a hint that he might have a more prominent role if a sequel is made. Finally, there's Jeff Bridges as the villain. An odd yet brilliant choice as the actor is refreshing and like his costar, he too needed an 'Iron Man' to give his career a boost.I noticed that some people were complaining that Muslims/Middle Easterners were portrayed as bad guys just like in any other American movie but I would like to state that this is no 'Vantage Point'. Here, these people weren't portrayed as terrorists working on their own but as men hired for a specific reason (I won't say more to give away spoilers). So I just thought to briefly clarify that this is no anti-Islamic or anti-anything (except, well okay, anti-weaponry) movie. It's a movie for everyone.Perhaps the story itself isn't anything novel which is what makes it somewhat similar to other superhero movies, but the treatment of it and its execution is quite unique. Add to that a fine cast and dazzling special effects among many things, this is the summer movie experience I've been waiting for in 2008. I wonder what else this summer has to offer as I doubt that it would succeed in providing anything close to the sheer entertainment of 'Iron Man'.",9 May 2008," Move Over Superheroes, Iron Man Is Here

They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts.

8,MisterWhiplash,"Iron Man is about as close to perfect popcorn entertainment as we can expect in this beginning of the summer season. But at the same time perfect in a certain sensibility of entertainment for its audience. One should know what Tony Stark's as a character not exactly the usual 'with great power come great response-yada-yada-yada' thing. He has a more jaded attitude, slightly more cynical than your typical man-of-steel (wait, sorry, iron, or alloy as it is). I'm almost reminded a little of Bill Murray from Ghostbusters, only with the catch of him being like Bruce Wayne without the grieving dead parents aspect.He has lots of money, lots of technical know-how as a wonder-kid/multi-millionaire, and he drinks and gambles and sleeps with whomever he wants. We as the audience don't identify with him as average Joe- some of us would want to be him for all the hedonistic perks available. And, when the time comes, he can whip up a technological breakthrough under the most dire of circumstances (i.e. under pressure of death to make a weapon for terrorists and instead making his quintessential suit).But at the same time, when Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, he does have a level of conscience from the start, realizing that the company that is under his name (if not one he entirely runs) has been manufacturing big-time weapons of mass mayhem (dont want to put destruction in there, though it's pretty much that), and wants to not want this any longer. Instead, basically, he takes matters into his own hands as some fantastical figure; instead of some army to take out insurgent terrorists in Afghanistan, he'll come and wipe em out in a jiffy. In this sense it's pure escapism, but also hitting on current issues (in the comic books it was similar terrain with him practically taking out Vietcong every which way). True, it might be much to imagine, but in the realm of a comic book movie, where we're already on the train of massive entertainment and being along for the ride of this character who can do what he does because he's that damn good.It's a thrill-ride, and it's very funny for much of the running time. And not unintentionally so like in, for example, Ghost Rider. It's genuinely hysterical to see certain things that make sense for Stark but are still wildly over the top in delicious ways (i.e. the strippers on the plane, yeah you read that right), or in just little things with how Robert Downey Jr. plays it. And make no mistake, this is pretty much a textbook example of perfect casting for a tricky character like this to cast. You want the charisma and appeal of a leading man, but can he also have something to him that speaks of the moral ambivalence and seedier bits to the character? You can't do it with a George Clooney, but with Downey Jr. it's a match made in not-guilty-pleasure heaven. He's able to bring the audience for the ride as a strong hero, but also hint at the fact that he's playing this character for what he is, and not cheating or skipping around the edges. Without him, it wouldn't work anywhere near as well.But to give director Favreau some more credit where it's due, also should be noted the near coup of casting Jeff Bridges as the villain - and as a character who is, basically, the ""anti-dude"" as it were - a dastardly figure who runs all of the shady dealings of Stark Industries and reveals his hand at wanting total domination of Stark's technology for his own means. His is a performance to relish among the great comic-book villain turns. But also noteworthy are supporting players: Gwyneth Paltrow, where'd she come from for this part that works this well? Terence Howard as well, and a couple of other supporting parts, they all seem to click just as well.Which brings me to the director, who should get credit where it's certainly due; coming from work as an actor/writer, going up through Made, Elf, and the recent bomb Zathura, it's a remarkable achievement to pull this kind of work off. While it goes without saying the script is already set for him to go, he doesn't tinker with it or his style to make it any more aggressively stylish than it needs to be. His is slick, efficient film-making, and even with witty moments to match up the bigger audience laughs (watch how he keeps the camera still through the POV of the lens Stark has up filming his botched 'test' in his rockets). For all the praise that Downey (very rightfully) will get for his work here, Favreau's is probably just as noteworthy in mixing rousing thrills and blockbuster entertainment and action while shamelessly delivering on the cynical side of the story. Just the final line, and how its delivered and in the context, is worth the price of admission.Oh, and by the way, stay through the end credits. If you're geeky about anything Iron Man (or awesome actors in eye-patches), you'll leave with a huge grin from ear to ear.",2 May 2008," supreme comic-book entertainment; it's also more jaded, and funnier, than most in its genre

10,pyrocitor,"With comic book films becoming an increasingly common component of the summer blockbuster season, the question emerges: how to make a mark as unique in the midst of so much superpowered competition while still holding true to the elements which made the originals such successes in the first place? It would seem director Jon Favreau has found the answer. From the opening chords of AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" it becomes instantly apparent that Iron Man is going to be a different kind of comic book movie. Instead of the filmmaker's usual aspirations to have the source material adapted as darker and grittier than its comic book origins could ever have been, Favreau is not afraid to embrace a very much needed sense of fun without descending into the rampant silliness which consumed Tim Story's Fantastic Four. As such, Iron Man essays a superb balance between embracing every last enjoyable detail while maintaining the gravitas and complexity of its original story and characters, a seamless melding of intelligence and action clout. What really sells the film is its intelligent script, with a series of astutely crafted lines a far cry from the usual clunking variety which could have been conceived by the average six year old boy. Favreau's Robert Altman influence also leads to some highly enjoyable improvisations on top of the scripted material (Downey Jr.'s exchanges with his robotic helpers are priceless). Similarly. by updating Stark's backstory from Vietnam to a more topical Afghanistan, the film has added political poignancy, making some intriguing tongue in cheek comments about the American military. While the occasional lapse in realism and occasionally conventional character motivations may prove problematic to some, such are easily excusable considering the medium from which the story is faithfully adapted, and Favreau's solid directing outweighs such inconsequential concerns with a sheer unabashed sense of enjoyment and unfiltered movie magic. Though the bulk of the story is dedicated to the usual origin tale, Favreau by no means skimps on the jaw-dropping action setpieces, generating some genuinely gripping and tense sequences (Stark's capture in Afghanistan is visceral and engrossing) as well as the requisite adrenaline pumping exhilarating ones - Stark's testing of his Mark One armour to escape captivity is full throttle entertainment and the final showdown is easily the show stopping setpiece of the year thus far. The film's flawless special effects are perfectly executed, used to full effect without ever swamping the picture. The Iron Man armour itself both looks and sounds brilliant, a clanking cacophony of assembled parts coming together for a heart pumping streamlined exterior. Similarly, the musical score, while not the most original, provides some suitably heroic themes and proves enthralling in its own right. Enough praise cannot be bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr., who, overcoming every last inch of apprehension over his casting, is by far the key element to Iron Man's standing out from the waves of other superhero films. Delivering one of the strongest performances in his formidable career, Downey Jr. effortlessly inhabits every last contradictory inch of Tony Stark like the pristine suits the character himself dons. Putting his own unorthodox spin on the character through his wisecracking, motormouthed energy, Downey Jr. still stays true to the spirit of Stark and his darker overtones, even making the transition from callous, arrogant billionaire weapons vendor to iron clad humanitarian feasible through his extraordinary charisma and gleaming, passionate intensity. To say that Downey Jr. is perfect for the role is an understatement; a testament to the use of quality actors for bringing immortalised comic book figures to life instead of ham-handed fresh young faces chosen for looks over talent. While the rest of the cast cannot quite match up to Downey Jr.'s dynamo of a performance, all prove equally adept in adapting their comic book incarnations in a plausible fashion. Terrence Howard delivers an appropriately curt dignity to Stark's military ally Jim 'Rhodey' Rhodes, adding the perfect clipped acerbic deadpan to the character. Similarly, Gwyneth Paltrow makes a surprisingly convincing potential love interest as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts, her natural charisma and share of icy comebacks easily proving a superb foil to Downey Jr.'s livewire of a performance. Jeff Bridges moulds his usual laid back image into one of a despicably greedy businessman concealing his shockingly selfish dealings under a veneer of oily respectability, his unconventional performance easily overcoming the trappings of his otherwise conventional villain figure. Shaun Toub is charming as Yinsen, the mysterious scientist who saves Stark's life in Afghanistan and helps him construct his first suit of armour, with Toub's irreverent edge preventing the role from becoming a stock ""mentor"" figure. Simply put, Iron Man is everything a comic book movie could hope to be: a perfect balance between the grittily serious and exuberantly enjoyable, flawless special effects and a roster of incredible performances. Iron Man proves an example of the quintessential blockbuster: one not afraid to think while simultaneously bludgeoning with entertainment - for those in search of entertainment without jeopardising brain cells, Iron Man should prove just the thing. -10/10",8 May 2008," Everything one could hope for in a superhero blockbuster

They kidnapped him and wanted him to make them a weapon, but instead he creates a suit that will evolve him into Iron Man.It's another billionaire hero. In this case one that is more deviant than the Bat and far wittier than the Spider. Iron Man is exactly that: he's a man's man. He sleeps around, he drinks and he is cockier than necessary and he doesn't even get paid millions to play a sport. Well he gets billions to create inventive weaponry for America.Iron Man was never my cup of tea. But when I heard that Robert Downey Jr. was going to play him I was sure that if there ever was a thing like cinematic perfection, that that was it. From that point on I was excited to see the film. What would I want more from this film? I can't really think of anything. It's not perfect but what movie is? It's just really good. I wanted to see the Black Widow somehow but that was not going to happen. I'm really pleased with the after credits scene. STAY AFTER THE CREDITS.What did I love about the film? Iron Man's suit. That suit was so freaking cool. I loved the way it looked, how it was put on, what it looked like in flight, how it sounded when it moved about, how it looked when it was damaged. It was just wow. I liked how Iron Man was just intelligent and figured out to do the practical thing without taking too much time to moralize everything. I like the wit of Tony Stark and how Robert Downey Jr. just perfectly fit the role as if he were born to play it.Terrence Howard mad a great Rohdey. As-a-matter-of-fact there were several scenes that just make a comic nerd giddy. Count them off, if you can. Jeff Bridges was intimidating and imposing as he needed to be to play Obadiah. Gwyneth Paltrow was Pepper Potts and had the charm and smile to pull it off. I liked the way she walked to. It might have had something to do with her shoes, but still it seemed so intentional for the character and it worked.The story progressed at an even pace and allowed for the development of the entire story within the allotted time. Jon Favreau (who also played the driver who, in the comics, becomes Pepper's love interest) did an iron clad job of directing. He knew what he wanted and executed it and it came out beautifully.The C.G.I. work was eye candy for the super soul. That Iron Man get up was just marvelous. The battles between Iron Man and anyone else was done well. There was not too much and there was not too little. Just like baby bear's porridge. The C.G.I. even helped with some humor moments that were littered throughout the film either by visual gags or witty lines; humor was not missing from the banter heighten Stark.Iron Man, the superhero, is a fine balance of cocky, womanizing, billionaire war mongrel with a touch of heroics all rolled into one likable man. It is simply a work of art. Normally such a person is the villain and not well liked, but not only is he liked in the comic books he's liked in the movie and that is thanks to Robert Downey Jr's portrayal.I was impressed. This is the first movie that Marvel has financed themselves and let's just sayit works magical wonders for them to have more power.There is no question that I will get Iron Man when it comes out on DVD. There is also no question that this will be the number one movie of the weekend and I even guessed that it would make a little over the amount of money it cost to make it. So I'm going to guess about $165 million dollars. Though because of Grand Theft Auto 4 it might be lower, a lot lower or so the nay sayers would scream. Iron Man is the nity-gritty hero, the one that is all bare on who he is and what he wants; he is Marvel's Stark Superhero and Iron Man is the start of a beautiful movie franchise.",3 May 2008," ""Iron Man"" the Stark Superhero of Marvel

13,atrainer-2,"Had I been the producer of this film I would never have cast Downie in the role of Tony Stark, and what a mistake that would have been. Robert Downie Jr gave an amazing depiction of Stark that was totally true to the character as envisioned by his creator and along with Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltro to name a few the cast did a brilliant job of bringing the Iron Man story to life. The story line was well thought out and flowed like a mountain stream, the balance between action and humour was as close to perfect as could ever be wished for, the entire film was engaging from start to finish even the music couldn't be faulted and as for the props, I really want an Audi R8 of my own now.

Not only that, but having Jon Favreau on board made me want to watch this film even more. He's a great comedic actor, and would seem like a cool buddy to hang out with.So I went in there with high expectations and I came out very satisfied at what I just had seen. I couldn't think of anyone else who could play Iron-Man better than Robert Downey. Thanks to this film, I put Iron-Man at the second spot in my favorite super-hero list. Blade comes first.Of course I bought the blu-ray version of the movie, watched all the special features and it was great. The action was great, it was planned out where it was needed. Jeff Bridges also did a great job on his character, acting as a mentor and then as Iron-Man's enemy. He didn't like to put up with the selfish rich guy, I get it, no one likes that.Overall, a 10/10 for creativity.

The premise sees a billionaire weapons merchant who is on the verge of death and kidnapped by terrorists until he creates a suit to escape. When he gets home he changes his philosophy and decides to become the superhero iron man. Robert Downey jnr was saved by this performance and it really has changed his career for the better. His dialogue is funny and witty and the smart thing the film did was as he changed you still loved him because of his whit and I love his character. The supporting cast is also fantastic especially the relationship between Downey and Gwyneth paltrow who plays pepper Potts. I have thought that this is the best romance in a comic book film franchise ever and their chemistry in this film is great and a big part of the film. There has been allot of controversy over Terrence Howard's involvement as James Rhodes but he is great in the role and his relationship with Tony is a big part about the mortality of the film. Jeff bridges plays obediah stane and he does well in his villainous role and his chemistry is really good with Tony. The story is really good as it shows a man change and decide to do what is right. Also even though this film is called iron man I believe that it is clear that this film is about the man and not the suit. The only negative I have ever heard about this film is that the film slows down when we get the cave scenes. However, I believe that these are great and they are real character building scenes for the lead. The script is really good especially with downeys dialogue feeling natural and is just hilarious. Everybody has great pieces of dialogue that really works for this film. The style is great with the look and the designs for the suit looking great.

18,scooter12589,"""Great, all that's on is Iron Man."" I said to my friend. We had missed the show time for the movie I had wanted to see. Upon first seeing a trailer for Iron Man I had low expectations. Just another poorly made comic book adaptation. It will be full of poor acting, crappy computer effects, and lots of action to overcome the lack of writing. Boy, I was wrong. Iron Man completely blew my expectations out of the water. Through the impeccable choice of characters, well placed action, and great mix of CGI: this summer's greatest action movie Iron Man is sure to please.Robert Downey Jr. is a hell of an actor. If not for him I am not sure I would have made it through Iron Man. It is rare that you find an actor that fits a role so well you forget he is an actor and think of him almost exclusively as the character. That is exactly what Downey brings to this movie. ""Is it better to be feared or respected? And I'd say is it too much to ask for both?"" and ""They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I prefer the weapon you only need to fire once. That's how dad did it, that's how America does it, and it's worked out pretty well so far."" These lines are delivered so genuinely and uniquely by Downey, you can't help but develop a relationship with his character Tony Stark that last throughout the movie.Often times when a screenplay writer can't write a good plot and can't write convincing dialog, they add copious amounts of action. Somehow, they have conceived the notion that if we are overwhelmed with action we won't notice how bad the movie is. However the audience is becoming smarter and no longer easily duped by such tactics. Iron Man did not resort to this. There is action in Iron Man, lots of action. But it is very well written and weaved perfectly into the story so as to enhance it. Iron man starts out with an attention grabbing fight scene. This is followed by many minutes without a giant fire fight where we get to know our protagonist; we bond with him and empathize with him. From then on the action and fight scenes are used sparingly till we arrive at the final fight scene between the protagonist and the antagonist.Several great advances have come to the movie industry from computer technology. One of these is computer generated imagery (CGI). CGI has allowed directors and writers to add elements to movies that were once though to be impossible, either due to price or far fetched ness. One complaint audiences usually voice is that is it too unrealistic. Not the case with Iron Man. The limited CGI use complements the movie well. Iit allows the viewer to vividly see exactly what the director and writers wanted you to see. All of this was accomplished without being annoying and causing the audience to be distracted by the effects.It is rare that a really good action movie based on a comic book comes along. Iron Man is one of those movies. Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post writes that it is full of generic fireballs and that some of the actors need to be cleaned up to make it as a sequel. I disagree. This summer's greatest action movie Iron Man is sure to please through the impeccable choice of characters, well placed action, and great mix of CGI. On a scale of five stars, I would give Iron Man five stars. I enjoyed this action movie so much I might have even paid for it!",5 May 2008," Downey Delivers

19,RikerDonegal,"After Superman, I believed that a man could fly. Now I believe that a man can redeem himself, no matter how badly he's fraked up in the past.And I could not be happier that they choose Robert Downey Jr. to carry this message. It works because it's his story, and it shows that he knows this. His heart is in every frame of this movie, his heart is in every word he utters, and your heart will be in the movie, too.It's a cool movie, with lots of things blowing up and stuff like that. But, it's a well-told human story first and foremost. If the X-Men movies strike a chord, it's because each one of us have known the pains of isolation and exclusion. If the Spider-Man movies strike a chord, it's because we all know the little fears and frustrations that drive our daily lives. And Iron Man?

DC did it first with their superman and batman movies...marvel was falling behind in the race before they even stepped on the throttle... But then something happened...I wasn't very old when the first x-men movie hit theaters but I remember seeing it and thinking: ""Yes! they're back!"" A lot happened since then. For my part, the x-men trilogy (yes, the third included) carried marvels ambitions for the big screen. I know many people loved the spider-man movies. I absolutely hated them. The hulk was a BIG disappointment, I almost vomited out of sheer anger when I saw the fantastic four and I won't even mention the daredevil movie. I am one of the traitors who thinks batman begins is the best superhero movie ever made...at least until now...Iron man blew me away! it's as simple as that. Everything, and I mean everything, in this movie runs as smooth as a well-greased machine. The cast is nothing short of perfect and Robert Downey Jr. shines as the eccentric playboy turned superhero Tony Stark, Jeff Bridges is a brilliant villain and Gwyneth Paltrow gives just the right amount of female touch to the movie and the chemistry between her and Downey Jr. is amazing.The movie is perfectly balanced between fast-paced, explosive action and well-timed humor. The CG is amazing as it was the first time I was able to see a movie with sports cars of that caliber and think: ""F*ck the cars, give me the suit!"" The movie also functions well for the person who isn't as big a comic geek as yours truly. All comic book adaptations requires a bit of faith and suspension of disbelief as, let's face it, people with anger management issues don't turn big, green and very strong in the real world nor does people who are bitten by spiders get their abilities. But this looks like it could actually happen in a not so far away future.It isn't just a movie about a comic-book superhero beating the crap out of the bad boys. It is also about taking responsibility and having the courage and will to make changes even though it isn't always the easiest way to go. Do yourself a favor and see this movie, It will give you a good laugh and get your pulse pumping.This movie takes Marvel back in the race and with the new Hulk movie coming soon and the likes of Thor and Captain America following not far behind it looks like they're closing the distance.",1 May 2008," It doesn't get better than this people!

22,leeharris100,"I typically don't take the time to write something like this, but I can make an exception for Iron Man. I am a huge comic book fan, and so far many of the comic book movies have fallen somewhere between mediocre and downright crap. There are exceptions to this rule (Spiderman 1&2, X-Men 1&2, Batman Begins), but Iron Man dominates them all. Downey does an amazing job of portraying the character of Tony Stark and he delivers one liners like no one else can. The composition and editing in the movie is perfect and the pace felt spot on. On top of all this, the visuals and music were the best I've seen and heard yet.Let me put this in perspective for you: my girlfriend fell asleep during Batman Begins and she thought the Spiderman series was ""ok.""

23,PeterWorthers,"First off, I like Robert Downey Jr. He's a very versatile actor. Any role he is in is brilliant, (Heart and Souls being a favorite) and Iron Man is no exception. He delivers lines almost as if he were making them up as he went along. His playful banter with other characters and various machines and small bits of comedy make the film very enjoyable to watch, and the events surrounding his capture and the first half of the film hit too close to home, adding to the films realism. We get the small nods to the comic geeks (You know who you are, myself included) with a cameo by Stan ""the Man' and even Rhodes making a reference to a War Machine suit that could be in his future. Plus on a personal note, it was good to see the Air Force (of which I am a member) was all over this film, we haven't had this much screen time in a movie since Stargate and the Transformers. Plus we're the good guys again, its nice to see it again, I hate when we're the bad guys; but then again I AM partial. Plus, the Air Force knows when to step in and when to let Iron Man kick a bad guys ass. But I digress. This film is just what we needed to (1.) get the summer movie season off to a good start and (2.) restore our faith in Marvel comic movies. (Need I mention Ghost Rider, Elektra, Hulk,the Punisher, Blade:Trinity, Spiderman 3need I go on?) It is good to see we can go beyond the normal heroes like Batman and Superman to someone who has real depth as Stark does, not because hes a superhero but because he is a screwed up person with many, many flaws.

24,jmarg,"First of all, I'd like to state that although I'm a comic books fan, I'm not that big on Iron Man; however, going to this movie completely exceeded my expectations.And what were they? Well, I looked forward to all the blockbuster trappings; big explosions, great special effects and since Robert Downey Jr. was in it (as well as some pretty decent actors) I assumed there'd be some _character_ in it as well. So far, even getting those things alone would have been worth the ticket price of admission.But the Iron Man movie went quite a bit further than that. The script for example was excellent - it used the normally rather boring origin part of a superhero's powers to actually both tell a story and advance the characters' points of view. We got to know Tony Stark in the process of him getting his armor - while, for example, Peter Parker being bitten by that spider gave us no insights on him.The humoristic elements similarly worked very well, dancing that line between slapstick and the movie taking itself too seriously. As bonus elements, 'real' (alright, for a comic book movie) engineering issues were more than referenced, they were true plot points - such as what portable power source could be adequate for such an energy-sucking armor, how extreme temperatures could affect its performance, or of course the obvious - how much does it weigh, and how could that be a problem in practical situations such as landing on a rooftop? I'm really happy this movie did well. We NEED to reward projects put together with such obvious enthusiasm for the material, or the studios come to think they can put any ol' crap with some special effects and a hot babe (I'm looking at you, Transformers!) and we'll go see it regardless. 10/10 from me for the best superhero movie made so far.

25,A_Different_Drummer,"About 1100 reviews on the old IMDb and I am going to do something I have never done before -- review on a bell curve.Seriously, before you start listing all the things you DIDN'T like, ask yourself how many live action Hulk movies have there been outside of the Avenger ensemble acts? Answer: Two. Only two. Just two.And the entry from Ang Lee was so wretched, so horrific, that this one gets a push up the curve.It is actually a solid film. Roth makes a great villain. Tyler was a great love interest. (The scene where Hulk becomes a giant fire extinguisher is one for the record books and memorable). And Norton is arguably the highest-level A-lister to ever play the role.(Or, also arguably, to ever play it again -- notice he was gone from the Avenger movies. Also notice that the two solo-Hulk movies did so poorly at the box office that this one actually ends with a promo for the coming Avengers, suggesting that the suits at Marvel are no longer interested in gambling on Hulk in a film by himself and all your future Hulk movies may be of the animated variety).All done, this is a much better film than the reviews would suggest.",20 February 2016," Grading on a Bell Curve

26,springsunnywinter,"By the looks of the ending of Ang Lee's Hulk (2003) it seemed that there is going to be a sequel. After 5 years we now have The Incredible Hulk which is a reboot like Batman Begins. The reboot was a better idea than a sequel because Hulk (2003) wasn't a bad movie but wasn't even great either and was better off as a one film itself. But if the first attempt at a Hulk movie left you feeling a little green, good news! This version has a whole new cast, a whole new mood, and even a whole new retelling of The Hulk's originWhen I saw the trailer of The Incredible Hulk I was like ""Wow this movie looks cool"" and it lived up to my expectation also the trailer did not give too much away about the plot. The film was outrageously entertaining, fun and a perfect popcorn movie. It is the same director of The Transporter 2 so it is bound to have good action. You can see every penny spent from the $130 million budget. It is roughly (not exactly) the same amount as Hulk (2003) and The Incredible Hulk looks much, much more expensive.The story is about Bruce Banner who is trying to cure is condition that turns him into a monster but is going to use it as his weapon against the Abomination. The plot may seem simple but it is better that way because you can just concentrate on the action and the monsters.This time the Hulk is more darker and sinister looking and is more muscular than Ang Lee's Hulk. The Abomination was the icing & cherry on the cake and I'm glad that they had a proper villain this time. His name really does match his personality and he is not wearing any underpants, so girls you might want to look away otherwise you might get a fright.

The only negative bit was not seeing Jack Mcghee. But he did get mentioned.2. The special effects were superb and making the hulk a more realistic size and strength rather than a light coloured green blob that is taller than the empire state building and can jump from city to city.3.Lou Ferringo did the voice of the hulk which I think was fantastic because lets face it he is the hulk. It was also great to see him in a different role and also Stan Lee appearing in another cameo.4. The depressing piano music was used albeit only for a minute or two.

Director Louis Leterrier and star Edward Norton made a film that is more true to the comics and the 1977 classic TV show, the special effects are a vast improvement with the Hulk looking more realistic and less cartoonish this time. The action is non-stop and there's also some emotion as well as it makes the viewer relate to the characters, look for appearances by Stan Lee with Lou Ferragino and Robert Downy Jr. as Tony Stark.Nice to see Marvel is getting back on track with their movies and this with ""Iron Man"" are a prime example, this is a must see experience.",19 June 2008," Excellent Marvel movie!

So what is your favorite Marvel film to date? X-Men? Spider-man? Iron Man? Well I'm a fan of all of those mentioned but I would say that The Incredible Hulk is better than the ones mentioned because it stays true to the comics/TV series. X-Men and Spider-man had lots of problems that I won't get into right now, and several are saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel movie now. Well, Iron Man may perhaps be the most ""fun"" film, but due to The Incredible Hulk having more interesting characters, great cinematography, and a great score make this an epic masterpiece. There are so many things in the film that made my inner-nerd geek-out, including cameos by the late Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno, and Stan Lee. I also loved the use of ""The Lonely Man"" and ""Hulk Smash"". The cast was also amazing in this...I believed that Edward Norton was a scientist on the run, that Liv Tyler and him had a past together and believable chemistry.

We actually want him to find a cure for his ""illness"" and not just break out into a Hulk fit at any random time.Instead of boring us with a dull backstory like Eric Bana's Hulk did, director Louis Lerterier (The Transporter) opts to show us the backstory in an opening montage during the credits. That way, we get right to the action. Bruce Banner (Norton) is living in Brazil, seeking a cure for his ""incident"". However, he is tracked down by General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who want to use Banner's substances to create ""supersoldiers"". Eventually, Blonsky takes some of the supersoldier serum and becomes like Banner, only evil. Banner teams up with girlfriend Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) to find a cure for his rage.In addition to Norton, it was nice to see Tim Roth finally get a starring role in a film not directed by Quentin Tarantino. Tyler portrays Betty well, and she and Norton have good chemistry on screen. Hurt's Ross was a huge improvement over Sam Elliot's, and Nelson is a fun character who comes off likable.Fans will love the cameos in this film as well. Tony Stark, aka The Invincible Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) shows up at the end, and Lou Ferrigno makes a cameo. But the real star is Norton and his big bad green self.

37,simonparker1990,"Ang Lee's movie Hulk received an extremely mixed reception upon its release in 2003. While it did deliver as a drama, and the performances were pretty good, as a Hulk movie it kind of left out the Hulk, we barely saw the big green giant, and for a comic book that took pride in Hulk smashing it really didn't feature an awful lot of it. I suppose it's no surprise that Ang Lee's version has almost been ignored, it wasn't a commercial movie, and while I appreciated moments of it the movie just really wasn't a Hulk movie. So The Incredible Hulk is rebooting the entire series, while its not a complete start over like Batman Begins it just seems like a fresh new break. And what a fresh break it is, The Incredible Hulk basically smooths over every flaw the original movie had yet maintains the quality drama from the first movie. But most importantly of all, Hulk finally smashes! The final fight sequence is pretty much one of the highlights of this year so far, it is truly incredible. The performances are also an improvement, Edward Norton being a much more accurate interpretation of Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler being superb as Betty Ross and Tim Roth, well just being downright brilliant on lead villain duties. Sure the movie essentially is a big dumb popcorn flick, but its also an extremely well made one. In fact I actually preferred it to Iron Man, although both are still some of the best superhero movies to date and both show a great improvement in terms of Marvel adaptations.So let me go more in-depth with the performances. Edward Norton really hit the core of Bruce Banner. I had nothing wrong with Eric Bana's portrayal in the original movie, but he just didn't suit the character as well as Norton does. Norton seems more the geeky scientist desperate for a cure, a man desperate to stop his inner self. The scenes at the beginning where he tries to control himself show a great performance from Norton, and the scenes he shares with Liv Tyler are touching. That leads me onto Tyler's performance, and I'd go as far to say she delivers the best performance in the movie. The scene where she finally sees Bruce again is brilliantly done, its done in a subtle way, but Tyler's performance just makes it all the better. A later scene in a helicopter with the pair is the highlight of their chemistry and one of the highlights of the movie. William Hurt is a great general in the movie, both villain and victim to an extent, Hurt really characterises a possibly two-dimensional character. And then there is Tim Roth, the caged animal of an actor who does villains like no other. He is brilliant, snarling constantly and wanting to more than he could ever be. The scenes before he literally turns into an ""Abomination"" show a brilliant performance from him, and makes it all the more apparent how the original movie lacked a suitable villain for the Hulk.But the main thing people want to know is how good is the actual Hulk in the movie. The CGI I thought was great, sure its not the best CGI in the world, but I began to believe he was there and the transformation sequences were extremely well done. But what Hulk does best in this movie is smash his way around. The three key fight sequences all being noteworthy, but the final just being stunning. The best scene in the movie, two words, ""Hulk Smash!"" I literally had a chill up my spine when I saw the scene and finally made me realise how happy I was to see the big green hero in all his glory in the big screen, and done well. The drama side of the movie is also done extremely well, in some ways it was done even better than Ang Lee's movie. The relationship between Bruce and Betty being vital to the movie, there scenes together are so well written and believable it really hits the heart. The movie also has a sense of humour, the best being Banner trying to keep calm in a New York cab. I suppose the biggest surprise of the movie is the fact the Hulk doesn't have to be on-screen to keep our attention, and that makes this the brilliant film that it is. Like Iron Man, Batman Begins and Spiderman 2 there are superb moments where we don't see the hero or the villain, there are moments that are small, subtle, yet brilliant. This makes this one of the best comic book adaptations to date, and one of the bigger surprises of the Summer.Overall The Incredible Hulk is a truly incredible reboot for a series I wasn't convinced could survive after Lee's movie. However this movie is stunning in almost every way. Its one of the best movies of the summer I have seen so far and definitely one of the largest surprises I have seen so far. I urge you to watch it, and prepare to see a proper Hulk movie.",12 June 2008," Hulk smashes to success

38,madbandit20002000,"When the huge, jade-skinned, sometimes anti-heroic behemoth, conceived by visionaries at Marvel Comics, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, got the movie treatment in 2003, fans a many were stoked to see the Incredible Hulk in full, CGI action. However, the film by celebrated filmsmith Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") was a wooden penny. Hulk dogs? The Hulk's dad becomes The Absorbing Man? The madder the Hulk gets, the bigger he gets? I'm just glad I save my money.I didn't, however, when viewing the recent comic book hero cine-relaunch (Batman being the first) which is a fun, rock'em, sock'em balance of human drama and high-edge action-adventure, the comic book and the classic TV series starring Bill Bixby as the tormented, gamma radiation-infested nuclear scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner and Lou Ferrigno as the not-so-Jolly Green Giant alter-ego. Compromising coolness is here for a superhero that can't take off the costume and call it a day, and that's what makes ""The Incredible Hulk"" interesting.Oscar nominee Edward Norton (""Fight Club"", ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"") fills the late Mr. Bixby's shoes, perfectly and hauntingly, being on the lam from the protocol-minded General Thaddeus E. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (a no-nonsense William Hurt). All Banner wants is a cure, but Ross and field soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Youth Without Youth"") makes things difficult, especially when Blonsky takes a ""super solder"" formula (a major hint to fanboys) to match monster brawn with the Green-skinned Goliath, and their fracas elevates to a monster mash in NYC's Harlem district. Good thing old Doc has the general's daughter, Betty (a mousy but lively Liv Tyler of the Lord of the Rings saga), as moral support and her heart as well.It's rare that movie producers can admit a ""mea culpa"" (money and rep, I guess), and ""The Incredible Hulk"", a combo of the Jason Bourne films and ""King Kong"", works. Director and fan Louis Lettierer (""Transporter 2"", ""Unleashed"" and an aide on the indie crime drama ""Gravesend"") does the script (a lost, first draft of the TV show's pilot episode, due to budget constraints and unavailable technology? ) by fellow fans Norton (uncredited) and Zak Penn (the second and third X-Men films) justice. Exceptional are the cast, especially Ty Burrell (the short-lived sitcom, ""Back To You"") and Tim Blake Nelson (""O Brother, Where Art Thou"") whose roles hint at a sequel (Like, duh). More eye winks towards fanboys are the cameos of Stan Lee, Ferrigno, Bixby (from an episode of ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"") and Robert Downey Jr. as his Tony Stark role from the super-hit ""Iron Man"", clueing into the Marvel Comics Universe. (Take heed, DC Comics and Warner Bros. Pictures). ""The Incredible Hulk"" does more than entertain; IT SMASH!!!",1 July 2008," Mean and Green When Antagonized; Get out of the (bleeping) Way!

39,mindsclay,"I liked the first Hulk movie because it was the Hulk, a Marvel character that I was so familiar with as a child reading comic books, watching cheesy animations and watching the TV series. THIS Hulk movie is more like tha actually Incredible Hulk I know and closer to the series.The Hulk in this movie was like the actually comic book character where he actually speaks and comprehends. The first Hulk movie showed him as a mindless brute. Also the first movie put too much emphassis on a relationship between Bruce Banner and his father David. And the new (original?) Hulk has more emotion.Choosing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was perfect. Besides Norton's acting, his small frame helped create the contrast between Bruce and the Hulk alter ego.There are a couple of cameos and some winks to the fans. Can't tell you what those are, that would be a spoiler. :) This movie had great live action/CG mix with camera pans that were flawless increasing the effectiveness of the illusion.The true Incredible Hulk or Marvel fan will love this movie.",26 June 2008," The Best Yet

41,robertallenandersonjr,"The Incredible Hulk was one of the best movies I have seen this year. It was definitely the best action movie this year. It was by far the best superhero movie and comic movie I have ever seen. The movie is not a big disappointment from all the hype. People might think it was way to over hyped but not me. I wasn't looking to forward to it but wanted to see it. So I decided to go to the midnight showing and it was so worth my money. I want to go see it again already. This is a movie you don't get sick of after seeing once. The action sequences were so loud and well written. They didn't have to much action about just as much as you would see in Iron Man or Spider Man. The story in this movie though was amazing. The story was very well explained. The movie started out write away with them explaining what went wrong and how Edward Norton became the hulk. This one was way better than the first Hulk they made. This movie probably had one of the best battles in any movie at the end when The good Hulk faced off against the bad. They made the Hulk look so good. I think that the visuals and special effects were so amazing. Especially each time they had action scenes. The action scenes went on for a long time and were very fun to watch. The acting was very good as well. Edward Norton did an amazing job playing the hulk. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job then Edward Norton did. Liv Tyler did a good job also playing the hulks girlfriend. She didn't have a ton of screen time but when she did she made the best of it. Everyone else did a great job as well. I don't think their were any flaws at all really. The only one I could possibly think of is that it kind of drug on toward the end. They made it seem like it was going to end and then it went on. The movie was well acted, loud, fun, entertaining, and was great for all ages. I think that even older people can enjoy it and even late teens. The language was not very bad for kids.

Liv Tyler was pretty decent as well and Tim Roth who played Emil Blonsky was good.i liked it how Bruce was in hiding for a long time and actually learnt ways to be able to keep himself relaxed so he wouldn't turn in Hulk.people say that the last i think bout 30-40 mins was a let down because it was just silly that The Abomination was destroying the city and that The Incredible Hulk had to fight and stop him. but i really liked the level of action that was in this movie.Of course Stan Lee has a cameo in this movie like he has done with the movies based off his characters but you also have a cameo of Lou Ferrigno...who is known to have started portraying the Hulk in the 70s TV series, he also does the voice of Hulk in this.good action, good acting, oh and you don't have to wait over an hour before you see The Incredible Hulk.",14 July 2008," this is way better than you think

43,jon.h.ochiai,"Poised in a helicopter high above the city, prepared to risk perhaps certain death in saving it, Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) tells the love of his life Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), ""Betty, I've gotta try"" ""The Incredible Hulk"" is the compelling hero story reinvented with a yearning love story in the foreground. The action is visually enthralling, and the Hulk himself is amazingly ferocious with ripped muscles and veins. Unlike the previous incarnation, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has a sense of humanity and pathos. Director Louis Leterrier (of the ""Transporter"" movies) and Writer Zak Penn (of the ""X-Men"" movies) have reinvented ""The Incredible Hulk"" as an exploration into the darkness of human nature all in the context of a brilliantly orchestrated action movie. Understandably, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is based on a comic book which had the pretense of retelling the story of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"". However, there is something noble in Bruce Banner's (Norton) journey to control the great anger and power within himselfThe Hulk. In that regard-- Edward Norton is powerful. His compelling performance humanizes and breathes compassion for a man coming to terms with his own darkness. Thankfully, those who saw Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" can finally forgive the sins of the predecessor.Leterrier and Penn's story begins with Banner in self-imposed seclusion in Rio de Janeiro. Recall that scientist Bruce Banner exposed himself to gamma rays as part of experiments for the military. However, something went horribly wrong during a transient gamma ray exposure. Under great duress or anger Bruce transforms into the green skinned beastThe Hulk. The Hulk is a seemingly mindless enigma of rage and destruction. Bruce must find a cure for his affliction. In Brazil, Bruce may have made peace with the raging beast within. He meditates. He trains with his Brazilian Jujitsu Sensei (martial arts great Rickson Gracie) to find his path. Sensei tells Bruce, ""To control your anger, you must control your body."" Bruce works odd jobs at a bottling factory, while researching his own cure. His only regret in self imposed exile was forsaking his true love, Betty Ross (Tyler).While Bruce may have found some peace the world, the rest of the world will not let him be. In particular, General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt), who regards Bruce as missing government property, is determined to hunt Bruce and The Hulk down. Even Bruce realizes that he inadvertently participated in a covert ""weapon"" conspiracy. General Ross enlists the talents of expert soldier Emil Blonsky (cold blooded Tim Roth). The singular focused and ambitious Emil is not entirely what he seems. Realizing he is overmatched in capturing The Hulk, Emil willingly volunteers for an experimental ""super soldier"" program, so he can engage The Hulk. This of course leads to the unexpected outcome: The Abominationa creature perhaps stronger than The Hulk.The battle scenes with General Ross's army and The Hulk are visually stunning-- thunderous mayhem. Leterrier gets his job done. The battle between The Hulk and The Abomination is dramatic spectacle. My bud Ron, pointed out that their battle is reminiscent in scale of Godzilla, but sans the camp. Through all this Liv Tyler as Betty grounds the story with an emotional resonance. There is a quietly touching moment when Betty distinguishes Bruce in a bar and a great scene when she embraces Bruce in the down pouring rain. Edward Norton's quiet power is the soul of ""The Incredible Hulk"". Liv Tyler is its heart. She brilliantly captures Betty's resounding regret, knowing she can never be with the man she loves. Edward Norton embodies the hero's courage and nobility. He is awesome. Also amazing is William Hurt as General Ross, who will sacrifice his very humanity and family to obtain his objective. Hurt brings a keen focus and unmatched duplicity.Amidst the epic scale action, ""The Incredible Hulk"" tells the compelling story of a man's search for peace within himselfthe noblest of pursuits. Leterrier and Penn reinvent a classic hero tale. Edward Norton is powerful and amazing. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a great movie.",17 June 2008," Incredible Movie

44,wayfarer001,"This one's pretty easy...if you've been wanting a Hulk movie, this is it! It's a fast-paced, character-driven, action-filled roller coaster that really delivers. This film is faster & less angst-ridden than the Ang Lee production a while back, but doesn't throw unthinking or purposeless mayhem at you either. Like Lee's, Leterrier's offering arrives owing more to the TV series than the actual comic origins (so no Rick Jones or gamma bombs), but does hew a bit closer to the Marvel Universe. Insiders will see lots of set-up for future outings in details like SHIELD, Drs. Samson & Sterns, and the long-abandoned Super Soldier Project. Like Downey last month, Norton pretty much carries the movie with a very engaging and nuanced performance. He plays the guilt-ridden conflicted hero well, and is supported ably by fine turns by Tyler, Hurt, and Roth. My main complaint: a sudden, inexplicably truncated ending that left too much up in the air, with only the slightest of epilogues. Actually, TWO epilogues. They give nice teases for what lies ahead, but did little in service to the story just seen.

But I was disappointed with Ang Lee's The Hulk(2003), that failed to do the character any justice, and not mention Eric Bana, don't get me wrong is a good actor, But his performance as Bruce Banner was over the top and unwatchable, and it made me miss Bill Bixby in the role. The Special effects where the only thing good about it. Now it's 5 years later, a new hulk film is here, and Edward Nortan has taken over the role as Bruce Banner. Still on the run from General Ross(William Hurt), Bruce keeps trying to find a cure for his violent transformation , While Ross's military unit is on his trail, He finds refuge with his long lost love Betty Ross(Liv Tyler). And that is all I'm gonna tell you. But this film was Incredible, the action where great, not to mention the effects where awesome.

With great acting by Ed Norton, who captures the bittersweet struggle that Bill Bixby bought to the character, and excellent acting by William Hurt as the cold calculating General Ross; this movie has few misses. Liv Tyler does a great Betty Ross, but Jennifer Connelly would have been even better because she would have brought more emotional depth to the character.All in all, money well spent and not too violent for the kids, as long as you go with them.

Overall this tops Spiderman 2 and by some distance i might add as the greatest comic book film to date. To start script is sharp witty, off the cuff, it quite often even verges into the Tarantino realm of dialog, so good are Downey JNR, Rockwell and Paltrow, that even the most menial of scenes become enjoyable, Rourke who was a worry for me was great not over the top and camp right on the money and also brought a great physical presence to his role. Johansson while looking the part, is the only weak point of the film for me, but even this is a minor note. But Rockwell, and Downey are close to perfection. With Rockwell having one of the better monologues in recent memory. Plot, pacing and coherence are perfect the movie just flew by didn't want it to end. There are no wasted scenes each is a treat onto itself no over indulgence or hammy dialog.Cinematography, mise'en scene, action, effects are all top notch. Sat in awe of how Iron man looks about four thousand times more realistic than spider-man, action has a really visceral impact without ever being choppy or shaky cam. Again cinematography is the major stand out and to quote R Lee Emmy film looked any better ""it would be a modern art masterpiece"" Directing is great i am now a devoted follower of Faverau he has taken all the annoying clichés and boring formulas that we keep seeing in these movies, and given us an action movie with brains brawn and the patience and execution to back it all up. There are no cop outs or annoying walls of writing where you can tell script is out of ideas and they just plonk something on the page, this is thought to the T, there is so much detail here its hard to take it all in, this one of those films you can go back and watch fifty times.

55,mikezexcel,"IRON MAN 2 was as good as it gets for superhero movies. It is a well-built story using characters and situations dating back to the 1960's. (Hence the nice addition of Tony Stark's dad in filmstrip sequences). The rivalry between him and a cold war Russian inventor plays out a generation later between Tony and the inventor's son, a character known as Whiplash (but never actually called that in the movie). I have to say the writing was top-notch and the characters excellently portrayed. For any armchair psychologists out there, the child-rearing theory of nature vs. nurture surfaces in Whiplash' origin. The young boy grew up in a climate of hate, and well, this is what happens. OK, getting too deep, more on the fun stuff...Paltrow as Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts, the director as ""Happy"" Hogan, and Rockwell as Justin Hammer all did a great job. Mickey Rourke dialed it down a notch and was superb. You will get some laughs from Favreau, functioning mostly as a chauffeur. Adding in the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) was a stroke of genius. Her fight sequence deserved applause! A nice touch: her decorative belt rings (first seen in Spiderman issue #86, 1970) became her weapons. Very cool! There's a reason I didn't mention Don Cheadle as Rhodey. His wooden performance was the weak spot of the whole film. I don't get it because he is such a great actor. But his presence was toxic and it looked like he threw off the other actors (noticeably Downey Jr).This film is great fun, balancing character development, science (best invention - Hammer's ""Ex-wife"" missile), thrills, politics and laughs. Highly recommended.",17 May 2010," Another great superhero movie!

56,sacflyzone,"This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2010, quite possibly the number one film. I really can't see anything that could possibly top this film. One of my favorite movie going experiences EVER. I was thrilled with Iron Man back in 2008 but this takes that experience and adds to it. I'm so happy to report that unlike other sequels made only for a cash grab, Iron Man 2 delivers on every front possible. There is no doubt why IM2 will be the box office smash of 2010. With good reason, the film is well worth the price of admission, more so then any movie I've seen in years. Director Jon Favreau has done it again, with great style and flair. The new actors are injected perfectly. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell and even good old Garry Shandling are exceptional. We all knew Scarlett Johansson could handle the sex appeal but she's especially good as Tony's new assistant/SHIELD operative. Don Cheadle trumps Terrance Howard's Rhodey in every way. I'm also relieved to report that Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Paltrow are even more amazing in their lead roles. They've really grown in to embodying these wonderful characters. What many don't realize but soon will is that this film has tremendous depth. The lead characters all respond to turmoil and are fleshed out beautifully. Judging by the commercials, people may expect wild action but they are going to be pleasantly surprised at the complexity and depth of the film itself. What only adds to the experience is the fact that they managed to deliver fun in to the equation. This masterpiece is one of those rare summer event movies that really does deliver something for everyone.",29 April 2010," A Pure Masterpiece!

57,Hellmant,"'IRON MAN 2': Five Stars (Out of Five) Like many second films in popular fantasy / action franchises (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK', 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'SPIDER-MAN 2', 'ALIENS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'X-MEN 2', etc.)'IRON MAN 2' takes what worked about the first film and totally ups the ante and creatively expands on the characters and drama of the first film to probably it's emotional and entertaining peak! It in many ways blows the first film out of the water. Although the action is a lot less frequent than you might expect, from a big superhero blockbuster extravaganza like this, when it does happen it's breathtaking; the race-car fight scene, which happens about a third of the way into the movie, is so cool it's mind-blowing and it's also emotionally intense (It's one of the raddest scenes I've ever seen in a movie and the rest of the movie never quite tops it; so the climax does happen pretty early on but that's OK, there's still plenty of quality movie left even so).What's best about the movie is not the action though it's the character drama and dialog; it would be a crime if this thing doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for best screenplay, although I'm sure that's a crime that will most likely be committed (Robert Downey Jr. also unarguably deserves a nomination for his acting performance as well though). The movie is jam packed with some of the most witty clever dialog and interesting character development I've ever seen in a blockbuster like this! The whole thing is a very complicated psychological character exploration, all revolving around the most fascinating superhero character to ever hit the big screen; the eccentric somewhat mad genius that is Tony Stark (once again insanely but amazingly portrayed by Downey Jr.).The film centers around Stark's battles (not with bad guys and world threats, but) with health issues (he's being poisoned to death by the machine he created, in his chest, that initially saved him), alcoholism, a Government that wants to take control of his technology for what they say is the good of the country and his overall fight to keep his sanity dealing with all this stress. Throw in Sam Rockwell as an impressively portrayed billionaire tech rival and Mickey Rourke as a soft spoken madman bent on revenge against the Stark family, who he blames for stealing his father's ideas, and you've got a complete circus act of oddly interesting characters. There's also Don Cheadle cleverly taking over the role of Stark's best friend James Rhodes (although Terrence Howard in the first film was better), there's a little Samuel L. Jackson being cool like always and there's some more Jon Favreau (more than the first film) that adds some nice comedic touches. There is a very sexy Scarlett Johansson playing another super hero named 'Black Widow' but the female characters are a little underdeveloped compared to the men.You can tell it was written by a man (actor Justin Theroux who's only other writing credit is co-writing 'TROPIC THUNDER', another Downey Jr. scene stealer); the women dialog is mostly important plot advancement stuff but with the guys 80 percent of it could have been tossed and the plot would have been intact but it's just so natural and entertaining; like real people shooting the breeze! That's the brilliance of the film! Favreau has also come pretty far as a director; he's much more polished now and knows what's most important to the film. The whole movie just has an energy to it that can't quite be described in words. It's an astonishing film going experience if you really like film!Watch our review show, 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxp3NkMebd8",14 September 2010," It just has an energy to it that can't quite be described in words!

More importantly, not only was it great value for a free viewing, but I plan to pay to see it again later this week.Sequels almost always suck, so I was expecting to be disappointed, especially as I loved the first movie (and I'm not a comic book movie fan, generally).Robert Downey Jr is just great, again! Iron Man, and now IronMan 2, is warm, and funny, and entertaining... because Downey is.Supporting characters from last time (Paltrow, Cheadle, Favreau) were fine, and provided continuity. Cheadle had a bit more this time, so we got the bromance thang going.This time Stark's joined by a bunch of new characters. Sam Rockwell was thoroughly entertaining as his arch-rival Justin Hammer, very funny. Scarlett Johansson got to wear some skin-tight outfit as an ass-kicking Russian spy, nice. Samuel L. Jackson, shows up briefly (but very coolly) as a one-eyed spy boss. And the resurrected Mickey Rourke shows off his Russian accent as the vengeful genius with a grudge, and a neat turn in remote controlled drone (very topical) Iron Men.And let's not forget the Ironettes!

60,jan_kalina,"And indeed it is. The first Iron Man came like lighting from a clear blue sky, a movie that started Robert Downey Jr's career, movie loved by audience and critics. Now there is a sequel and people are asking if it's worth it. And I say Hell Yeah.Now when the whole world knows who Iron Man is, Tony is having a hard time staying alive. There are two men coming after him, a Russian Ivan Vanko who has an unfinished business with Tony. He claims that he stole the idea for the arc reactor from his father (which of course isn't entirely true, he is a Russian, you can't believe those.) The second guy after him is actually a competitor in business, Justin Hammer, who, for years is trying to build a suit like Iron Man's but with horrible results. Now with the government wanting Tony's Iron Man suit and Stark Industries closed for business, he has a chance to become the leading weapons industry. The acting and the cast here are truly remarkable. Robert Downey Jr. is, well he is Robert Downey Jr. He is perfect as usual, you can't miss with him being cast in your movie. Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job being the love interest. Mickey Rourke doesn't have much time on screen but when he is you can see he enjoys the role and still tries to establish the character even with such limited screen time. Sam Rockwell is the comical villain and he is great at it. Samuel L. Jackson is a synonym of the word cool and he proves it once again as Nick Fury. He briefly appears but when he does he's got one of the best lines in the movie such as ""Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the donut."" or "" I am very real. I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet"". The weakest link in the chain is Don Cheadle. He horribly doesn't fit as James Rhodes. He is uninteresting, and he acts too serious for this role. This is supposed to be entertaining, fun movie. And when he has no idea what to do, he copies Terrence Howard's take on this character. His character changed from the best friend ever to the worst friend. He became arrogant too. He actually thinks he is better than Iron Man!! But that of course isn't true. As always there is a great little cameo by Stan Lee. I can't forget all the rush on the internet Olivia Munn being a superhero and then she had just a tiny cameo as a news reporter. I was chuckling in the theater and no one had idea why.Casting Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was the smartest idea anyone ever had. She is the sexiest woman on Earth and seeing her in a tight leather suit is worth all the money on Earth. Her only fight scene in the hallway with like a dozen guards is amazing. It is one of the best choreographed fights of this year. It is just purely awesome, sexy, full of adrenaline and even funny.I just feel like all those composers started to try again after last year's (almost) fiasco. OK, there were few exceptions, the Star Trek soundtrack, Up soundtrack and the Sherlock Holmes soundtrack. In this year there is more than just three great soundtracks and Iron Man 2 is one of them. The score is darker and more bad-ass. Three tracks that really stand out: the first track (Ivan's Metamorphosis), Monaco Drive with this heavy James Bond feel and the track titled Black Widow Kicks Ass. Soundtrack as such features songs from AC/DC, Queen and even Daft Punk.There are more action scenes in this one than in the first movie. The action scenes are much better, they are fast paced, bad ass, simply better. There is even one car chase scene.In summary, if you liked the first then I guarantee you that you will enjoy this one too, it's a must-see for any fan of Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Iron Man or a comic-books. (There are tons of comic-book references including the Avengers, Hulk and it's just great fun looking for them.) This is a great, entertaining summer movie so go and watch it.Definitely wait until the end of the credits there is a great extra scene and you find out what agent Coulson was doing in New Mexico.",17 November 2010," ""It's Good To Be Back""

61,g-bodyl,"I went in the theaters with an open mind ready to expect the best and that is what I got. Iron Man 2 is just as good maybe even better than the first one. Robert Downey Jr is superb as Tony Stark once again. I also loved the performance by Mickey Rourke as Whiplash. I didn't expect much out of him. And of course we all know why Scarlett Johansson is here.This movie takes place right after Stark becomes public. He has to deal with the government who wants to take his suit and Whiplash who wants to kill him because of his father, Howard.I loved everything here. I enjoyed the action, the chicks, the cars, the special effects, and much more. The only thing I really hated was that Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard. I love Cheadle's acting but Howard was perfect in the first one.Overall, this is a fantastic sequel. I hope they make Iron man 3 and I can't wait until the Avengers in two years.

62,XweAponX,"A couple of things we knew we were going to see - hinted at in the 1st Film - Rhodey as War Machine, the Suitcase-Suit, the dying Stark who has to drink 80 glasses of Green Machine a day, Pepper Potts as the head of Stark Industries - S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury and The Avengers - Black Widow! We get to see all of it in some form or other in this excellent Sequel. Adding to my belief that Robert Downey Jr was practically born to play Tony Stark, he builds on the first performance and reveals even more about who Iron Man is.Nothing really can be said about this that otherwise cannot be seen by simply watching the film. In Blu-Ray if Possible, on DVD if not... Looks good both ways.My only beef is that Terence Howard did not reprise the role of Rhodey/War Machine - But the addition of Scarlett Johanssen as Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, Mickey Rourke as Vanko, and Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury - Ease my initial disappointment at seeing Don Cheadle take up the mantle of War Machine - But the fact that Cheadle plays it JUST like Howard did - Even the Mannerisms, so it really IS the same Character, Cheadle does the best he can, not being Physically matched to Howard but personality-wise captured it. Also, the repeat performance of Leslie Bibb as the Vanity Fair Reporter Christine Everhart was well used- Even hinting that she was a fair Reporter, so maybe if there are any more of these, we'll get to see her come back, probably one of my favourite characters from this franchise. Finally, director Jon Favreau gets to be Happy Hogan a Lot MORE in this film much to my relief (Why recreate a great Iron Man character and only show them twice? Much better to have them in the film as much as the story can benefit by it?) The choice of Justin Theroux/Screenwriter made this a much darker story than the initial Iron Man story - As Tony builds Iron Man in the first film, this film mirrors that by having Vanko building his Arc-Reactor weApon. I thought they were bringing In Omega Red (X-Men Villain) into the story with the addition of Vanko, but apparently this is a combination of a couple of Iron Man Villains.This film is just another link in the upcoming promise of an Avengers film, and Marvel is gathering all of its forces for this effort. One thing we do know is that Iron Man WILL be a major part of The Avengers - And I ain't talking about Emma Peel!",26 September 2010," Upped to the 10th Power

63,kotrynamacca,"I gotta say, Robert Downey Jr. is the best actor I've ever seen! He beats out greats like Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt. He never ceases to impress and woo. Every movie he is in, he always steals the spotlight. Robert is perfect in any role he plays. He has got to be the most charismatic guy on the planet. AND the best looking! Yes, his handsomeness is on great display in this amazing film! Now, getting to Iron Man 2, it triples the magic of the first one! The script (and some hilarious obvious ad-libs by Robert Downey Jr.), the plot, the acting, the casting, the chemistry amongst the actors, the directing, the effects, the sets, the messages- PERFECT. PLUPERFECT.The comedy, the drama, the action, the themes, the FUN! My oh my, this movie was something a sequel never is- better than the first! First off, I LOVED the first Iron Man- absolutely adored the film. I had high expectations for Iron Man 2, but I thought it would be impossible to make the sequel any better than the fantastic start to a franchise was. But, I was wrong! Iron Man 2 is 10 times better than the first, if that's even possible! Honestly, I think everyone in the world should see this movie. I'm a big movie buff, and I say this only about the films I truly love. The plot was more complex this time with more subplots to add to the fantastic story. This is nothing like your regular superhero movie. This isn't Batman, Spiderman, or Superman. This is as realistic as it gets. This is something that could truly happen in real life, especially nowadays. It very much applies to modern times and modern problems. This is a very realistic man dealing with very realistic problems. By the way, Tony Stark wasn't that narcissistic at all, even though many people seem to say he was. RDJ portrayed him as truly likable with real emotion, charm, and on-the-dot comic timing. A real-world hero. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark will go down in history as one of the big screen's most memorable characters. This movie kept the audience laughing throughout with the superb witty dialogue and many intentionally hilarious scenes laced with intelligent humor. The movie had some truly emotional and serious scenes, courtesy of the great talent of Robert Downey Jr. It is art. It is pure charm on display for all to see. It is a gift. It is true talent and ability to sway the emotions of the viewers. Robert is my hero- in more ways than one. As a woman, I am so happy a man so ideal actually exists! Is he peerless? Quite possibly!The serious undertones of this action-packed intelligent comedy give the movie its edge. The fact that this movie very much applies to the real world is very appealing. The Avengers is next, but that will contain the unrealistic superheroes like Thor and Hulk, which belong with Spiderman and Superman...that won't be the same...the Iron Man franchise is the real superhero franchise- not a kids' make-believe one. Iron Man 1 and 2 have such great charm and that real-world quality that are not present in the Batman franchises, the Spiderman franchise, the Superman franchise, the Hulk movies, and all the other superhero films. Iron Man 2 is unmatched in its strength as true coolness and top-notch entertainment. It is so smartly written and performed that it makes me truly proud of Hollywood. Thanks to RDJ and Jon Favreau! I am more than pleased with Iron Man 2. I am beyond blown away. It's worth every penny to go and see it! I'm going to see it for a third time next weekend!This film is eye-candy, brain-candy, and heart-candy!",16 May 2010," Robert Downey Jr., you did it again!!

64,SloberDon,"WOW! The director has crafted a super sequel that both dazzles the eyes and touches the heart. Much like Spider-Man 2, the truly remarkable special-effects of the new movie make it virtually impossible not to suspend one's disbelief. The effects actually beat Spider-Man 2. A lesser filmmaker would have been content to let the effects be the whole show, but Favreau gives us a movie populated by genuine characters and situations that make the film just as compelling in its quieter moments as it is during the big action scenes. IM2 combines the thrills of a big summer romp with the craftsmanship of a prestige studio picture. It's not simple popcorn fun although it certainly works in that capacity but it's as complex as its conflicted protagonist. It's a slickly engineered special-effects extravaganza with a saucy sense of humor that's well-acted and masterful at every turn. That's the kind of movie that I love to see one that isn't just dark to be dark or isn't just self-indulgent or overly serious for the sake of having some sort of false sense of gravitas.

72,jon.h.ochiai,"In the noisy gaudy opening of ""Iron Man 2"" billionaire bad boy Tony Stark arrives at his Stark Expo in the Iron Man suit. Once removed from his body armor, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony admits, ""It's all about legacy."" Amidst the fun, high energy and stupid plot line, legacy does resonate as a poignant theme. I agree with A.O. Scott, that casting overcomes a lot in ""Iron Man 2""—I think I liked the movie more than he did. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. And Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko provides what every hero story requires: a formidable villain. Director Jon Favreau is smart in never taking the movie too seriously, letting his actors morph and evolve. Favreau provides some spectacular action and visuals. The Monte Carlo Grand Prix where Vanko attacks Stark is stunning and heroic high drama.Downey is amazing in carrying off such a wide-band character in Tony. His Tony even cops to being a text book narcissist. Downey is one of the gifted actors, whom we can discern what is going on in his mind—through his eyes. He brings a crisp intelligence, brashness, and sobering humanity here. We learn that the palladium core that keeps Tony alive is rapidly poisoning his blood and killing him. At the same time S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (cool Samuel L. Jackson) wants Tony to uncover his father Howard's legacy, and solve the mysteries of his heart—on also a more profound level. Tony confesses his estranged relationship with his Father—""He never told me that he loved me."" But in his research Tony watches a message from his Dad. He says proudly, ""You are going to change the world what has always been and always will be my greatest creation is you, Tony"" From then on I was into the movie.""Iron Man 2"" may not be a good as the first, although it has a huge upside. Scarlett Johansson is hot as S.H.I.E.L.D. ""triple agent"" Natasha Romanoff. She looks stunning in tight leather and performing Jeff Imada designed fight choreography. Beautiful and sprite Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role of Tony's worried assistant Pepper Potts—who Tony appoints as new CEO of Stark Industries. Tony and Pepper are so in love with each other. Will they ever figure this out by the end of the movie? You have powerful actors Downey and Rourke squaring off. Rourke is menacing and dangerous—he plays it dead on. In a subdued interrogation scene Vanko tells Tony, ""If you make God bleed, people will cease to believe in him."" Vanko is out to avenge his own father—defending his own legacy. Sam Rockwell nails the pompous and annoying Justin Hammer, Tony's industrial competitor. Gary Shandling is dead pan genius as the Senator, who demands Tony turnover Iron Man. To which Tony reminds, ""I have successfully privatized world peace."" ""Iron Man 2"" is visually stunning with the spectacular battle with the Vanko built drones at the story arc. It is also a lot of fun as self destructive Tony in Iron Man suit dances to the late Adam Goldstein's mixes. ""Iron Man 2"" is an action packed, fun, and funny mixed bag. It's not all that coherent. It's engrossing mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke, and its surprising story of legacy in spite of itself. And that works as well.",17 May 2010," Fun and Legacy, Too

The 2008 Iron Man film, I found to just be okay. I think the thing I really liked about it was Robert Downey Jr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He was narcissistic and arrogant and the performance was pulled off perfectly. However there was little else for me to be impressed upon in the first film because I found most of the other performances to be lacking character and emotion, the story really did not do anything for me and the action and special effects sequences went on too long and became a big part of the story, whereas I prefer more background on the characters, the hero and the villains. It was an okay film, but not great. I wasn't sure how I would like Iron Man 2 after my disappointment with the first outing of what is sure to become a series, but I actually liked Iron Man 2 better than the first film, a lot better. First of all, I found the acting a lot better in this one from everybody and the newcomers were really good also. Secondly the film gave us more of a back story to the characters and villain and I found it got more personal this second time around. Instead of just non stop action and explosions there were more scenes letting us know these characters better and I found that to be far superior and more interesting than non stop excitement from the special effects department. I also found this version to have more humour in it and there are certainly some smiles and chuckles coming your way and it made the film a lot more fun and entertaining for me than the first one. I think fans of the first one will likely be a bit disappointed with this version and the reviews tend to reflect this because it is not as action packed as the first film and I have also read complaints that people had of the writer and director trying to put too much into one two hour film. There is quite a bit going on this time around, but I did not find that the film suffered because of it. Instead, I found it gave us more to look at and think about and was a pleasant alternative to the non stop action scenes I mentioned above. The writing I also liked a lot better because it gave us more time with the characters, had a more interesting story and because some of the one liners and humour that I mentioned were in the film earlier. These last few years it seems that most superhero films have been compared to 2008's The Dark Knight because of what a great film it was and I would have to agree. I don't think you will get too many that will get the genre right and give us as interesting a look at it as in The Dark Knight, but we may yet still be surprised. Iron Man 2 while I am giving it the same rating as The Dark Knight, is not as good as The Dark Knight, but as a film in this genre, I do think it is one of the better ones. The Dark Knight was more gruesome, dark and disturbing while Iron Man 2 is definitely lighter and more kid friendly than The Dark Knight and is not as much into the development or psyches of the characters. Iron Man 2 knows this and more, or less just wants you to have a good time watching it and leave feeling entertained. For those goals Iron Man 2 succeeded and then some.",17 May 2010," Iron Man 2

75,sidfargas,"Thor was much much better than I expected. I didn't know if they could pull of the balance between the Norse mythology stuff and the real world Marvel Universe. I should've known better because Marvel knows their characters and knows what we want to see. Spider-Man set a new standard for the superhero film genre back in the day. Iron Man upped the ante. Thor takes the ball and runs with it and places that bar even higher. I look forward to seeing it again and know it will do well enough to be worthy of a sequel because word of mouth is going to be great. Trust me when I say Thor REALLY IS as good as Iron Man and is most worthy to be called one of the greatest adaptations ever.Chris Hemsworth as the Norse god Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as his villainous brother Loki show they have the acting ability and star quality to become mega-marquee names in the future. Marvel found two absolute diamonds in the rough. Both actors make a HUGE impression and are wonderful on screen. You knew Acedemy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman would bring it but these relative unkowns more than hold their own on screen. I know the script is written mostly for them but they carry it in a big way. From what I've read, Hemsworth and Hiddleston were cast almost a year in advance of filming the story so, they had time to get into shape and do character research. They certain did these long-time Marvel greats proud.

76,assman200,The first blockbuster of 2011 may be the best. They certainly set the bar very high. It's an exciting and certainly an all-around entertaining comic book adaptation. Nothing in this genre since LOTR has been any better. Everyone involved in the production should be proud to know that their movie can stand toe-to-toe with the likes of anything else that summer can throw at them.They found the perfect combination of spectacle and guts and passion balanced with the human dynamic of the character. It delivers mind-bending visuals but it still very intelligent and thrilling. How many summer films can you say that about that you've seen over the past ten years or so???? The actors REALLY brought the characters to life. It was really amazing to see it develop on the big screen. There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a star in the making and a rather astounding leading man. Thor is a dazzling example of the superhero movie done right. There were some parts in the movie where I was just blown away. This film has a depth that no one could have expected and is very impressive in scale and design.I love how the movie played out and it exceeded all my expectations.

77,smlubecki,"When I heard they were making a movie of the character Thor I had serious trepidations. When I heard that Kenneth Branagh was directing it I had even more trepidation not due to the fact that it was Branagh but the fact that all he's ever directed was drama's.Going into the theater I very low expectations from this film and man was I blown away. I like the fact that Branagh didn't approach the story as a super-hero film but more of a Shakespearing epic. The fantasy elements alone were marvelous.Anthony Hopkins IS Odin...I cannot imaging another actor portraying him. His performance as Odin captures the essence of the character and the delicate balance of ruler verses father. He exudes power with subtle touches of vulnerability.Chris Hemsworth is outstanding as Thor. He's got such a likability about him that even at Thor's most arrogant point in the story you can see how his friends stand by him. His performance is rock solid and extremely enjoyable. Tom Hiddleston is THE perfect Loki. He's captured the sleazy, slimy, be nice to your face but looking for a place to drive the knife in your back nature of the character.As I had stated earlier the story plays out as more of a fantasy epic than a dyed in the wool super-hero story. The journey into Jotenheim was stunning and Asgard itself was just beautiful to behold. The set designs were excellent. The humor in the film was very organic and never seemed forced. The story itself was very well balanced and didn't leave you wondering what the heck was going on. I almost wish they'd have kept it separate from the upcoming Marvel films. It works very well as a stand alone epic.The effect's that I was expecting to be sub-standard were in fact top notch and even Thors trademark spinning hammer from the comics didn't look as cheesy as it could have. This movie is a gem. All parties involved should be proud of themselves for bringing such a great piece of work to the screen. I for one cannot wait to see a sequel to this film.

78,John_T_Chance,"Another outstanding effort, Marvel does it again! It's hard to believe that a movie with this subject matter can make you think and challenge all your movie viewing skills but it does so and more. It's very artistic and you would expect no less from Kenneth Branagh. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would've thought. The pacing was perfect as is the link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can't wait to see what Captain America brings us. Overall, a summer movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen in years.The director's background in Shakespearian themes comes in to play right from the beginning of the film and run throughout. Thor is a super-strong ""god"" and can travel through space with supernatural powers yet the story is paradoxical and contrary about those elements instead choosing to focus on the human elements. THAT elevates this film far beyond anything I was expecting but I should have known better considering the source material and the director.The genuine and relatable qualities of these characters are what make it a great film. Sure, the action and fantasy are incredible but the story works so well. The family dynamics between fathers & sons along with sibling rivalry and the price of vanity and lack of humility all resonate. The choices made and the relationships on display are as wonderful as the brawling and action... which are as good as any summer movie that I've seen in years.",26 April 2011," Incredible Action and Fantasy but with a Superb Story!

And I liked the fact that it was used in a way that I didn't jump in the seat from some item ""coming out of the screen"", it just made it more exciting to watch. The acting was good, Hemsworth was perfect for the role, just as I have pictured Thor to be. And the movie had a lot of humor as well as action. I liked the switch between Asgaard and our world, it gave the portrait of the gods a twist and some humor. And I loved Thor with the hammer in the action scenes - that is some power to have.This might not be a movie that will haunt your mind, but for the purpose I went to watch it - pure entertainment - it was perfect.

81,k_wallander,"My title really sums up how I perceived this great movie. I just returned home from watching this tonight. And holy cow, Mr. Brannagh really delivered!! When Kenneth Brannagh was announced as Thor's director, I was really expecting something great from the one who directed various Shakespeare adaptations. I've only saw his remake of ""Sleuth"", and despite weak ratings from the critics I really liked that crime flick. I really loved how he handled the characters. Brannagh really knows how to set the stage for clever and suspenseful drama. Furthermore I adore him as an actor (my IMDb nickname says you that).So as a longtime comic-book fan I was really excited getting to see a visually spectacular and dramatic comic-book adaptation by a skillful director. And boy my expectations were fulfilled. F...... hell, this rocked!! The (first two) X-men and Iron Man movies were always said to be the Marvel Masterpieces when it comes to movie adaptations. Personally I always thought these movies to be entertaining, but not much more. They didn't really deliver an epic feeling. They didn't introduce you to a fantastic world in all it's glorious beauty that wants you to explore it. ""Thor"" just delivers all that. To me ""Thor"" stands as the best Marvel comic-book-movie till now, by far...First of all, the characters are really likable and portrayed in a realistic way. All character developments don't seem to be forced. The most interesting character is Loki. At the beginning I really felt sympathy for him. It is until a tragic revelation, where his character undergoes a change to a more evil side, but even then some of his behaviors seem to be understandable. The father-son conflict is portrayed brilliantly. Kenneth Brannagh at his best!!This movie is visually outstanding and some scenes, like for example the prologue, deliver this ""LotR"" feeling that gives you the goosebumps. There are many memorable shots that are purely majestic. When Thor, Sif and the Warriors Three ride on the Bifröst it just shouts ""pure awesomeness"" into your face. Many scenes on Asgard are just spot on. The buildings on Asgard seem to be based on a hybrid of krypton and middle-earthen architecture. The visuals on this world show the advanced, noble and god-like status of the Asgardians. Asgard is depicted as a heavenly and unbelievably beautiful realm in the never-ending depths of the cold space. It provides a subject for speculations, if the Asgardians are indeed gods with magical powers, or if they are extraterrestrial beings with technology far beyond our understandings, but the movie doesn't really discusses this issue and leaves it to the audience to give an opinion in this matter. What else can be said? The action was exciting. While the frost-giant-battle on Jotunheim was a bit visual overkill and at some parts almost cartoony, the fights on earth were harsh, gritty and bloody. Brannagh really handled the different worlds very well. On earth, humor was predominant, the scenes on Asgard stood out for Shakespearian drama, while Jotunheim delivered a creepy and threatening atmosphere. The CGI-Environments were all breathtaking. There were sequences (Bifröst, Asgard mainly) that really were out of this world. All in all, the visual effects were amazing and god-worthy. The score was magnificent, it perfectly captured the proudness and courage of the Asgardians.I gave ""Thor"" a 10 out of 10. It surely is on of the best movies of it's kind. I stands up there with ""The Dark Knight"", ""Star Trek"", ""Avatar"" and ""Inception"". It's the perfect Blockbuster.",30 April 2011," Oh my god!! Everything I expected, and much more...

84,adrianaling,Thor is one of my favorite Marvel movies. The characters were fun and the world building was fantastic. I was so excited to see the visual effects that brought Asgard to life. Chris Hemsworth really is the perfect Thor and Tom Hiddleston is perfect for Loki. The only actor that fell short was Natalie Portman. Her acting was very bland and for a top-billed actress she should have put more effort into the character of Jane Foster. It seems that she had become so unlikable that she was written off during Thor: Ragnarok. Thor is the best character in the whole Avengers roster and seeing him on the big screen was a real treat. The plot was a simple hero's journey but the growth and action has made this film even more enjoyable with each viewing. My favorite scene was the battle on Jotunheim because of how great the effects were and the choreography of the fight scenes. It did not feel like they were just actors playing near a green screen. Thor was the first Marvel film to succeed in creating dynamic new worlds that felt as real as the action scenes in New Mexico.Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Fiege brought a lot of comedic and memorable moments that are still referenced in other movies and shows.

The story is put together in a lovely way, and Natalie Portman's Jane is played with significance. Darcy is always there to brighten the day, and the link with avengers is intriguing beyond doubt.

He's perfect because he certainly fits the part physically but, more importantly, he's able to play Thor both as a mighty pompous loose canon as well as being a big lovable ""god out of water"" unable to adjust to human ways. Both are absolutely crucial to the character winning audiences over, especially those who may not be familiar with the character from comics. Hemsworth and the script does this with style. I also love the texture of this film. Example: The power struggle within Asgard between Thor and his brother and Thor and his father, Odin. It feels very relatable and very passionate.

89,jan_kalina,"Surprisingly Thor has got the magic of an amazing, popcorn overflowing, comic-book movie. I have to say I was quite sceptical about this movie, the footage in the trailers looked pretty lame and stupid, but the great reviews I kept reading about this movie made me change my mind to go and see the movie.When I read that Kenneth Brannagh is directing Thor I had no idea what to think about it, I mean a renowned Shakespearean director and actor at the helm of a high-budget comic book movie? It just didn't seem like a good idea, but I didn't believe that Jon Favreau could pull off a good movie with Iron Man and he proved us wrong and so does Brannagh. It seems that Marvel has got good hand on picking the directors. The character of Thor is a tricky one to translate to screen. Firstly Thor isn't like other superheroes, he isn't human, he is a God, one who was worshiped by ancient Norsemen. The story might be simple but that doesn't matter if it's well told. Thor is cast down to Earth by his father Odin for his reckless actions that reignite an ancient war and is forced to live among humans. Thor is one of the most charismatic, arrogant, noble, physically imposing, powerful and romantic characters that have come on screen recently. Chris Hemsworth brings all that into the character so he proves himself as a great actor. Brannagh handles the action scenes very well. A guy huge like a mountain fighting his enemies with a hammer sounds silly but it looks great on screen. Hell, it actually kicks ass. The action is exactly how I expect it from a comic book movie: it's cheesy, little bit over the top, fun and kick ass. Brannagh was chosen for this movie for another reason, he knows that in a summer movie the action can't be simply there just for the sake of having action scenes in a movie. You need emotions and he delivers that through almost Shakespearean family tragedy. Anthony Hopkins as Odin is amazing, when he shouts ""Silence"" nobody ,even in the cinema, says a word. Tom Hiddleston gives here an incredible performance as Thor's devious brother Loki, who is scheming against everyone, hidden under this facade of a meek. Natalie Portman as a beautiful young scientist hasn't got much to do in this movie just to be amazed by Thor and you can see that she really is. When he kisses her hand as a noble man you can see how she is falling for him in love. I love how the writers incorporated S.H.I.E.L.D. into the story in such a casual way. Once again we get the marvelous Agent Coulson. His interactions with Thor are the funniest and also the most tense one. Idris Elba as Heimdall the guard is a perfect casting choice. He is calm, great in action scenes. He is just perfect. There is also Rene Russo as Thor's mother Frigga but unfortunately she doesn't get a lot of screen time.In the end this is exactly what you pay for and even more. Thor is one of the greatest comic book adaptations, it's funny, has great characters and actors,great score/soundtrack by Patrick Doyle, amazing visual effects, great action scenes. In my opinion it's a comic book movie the way they are supposed to be made.Watch out for a great Stan Lee's cameo and as usual with Marvel movies stay till the end of the credits for a genius post-credits scene.Thor will return in The Avengers.",29 April 2011," ""Your ancestors called it magic but you call it science.

I expected the worst (as I love the Norse mythology and spirituality) and was stunned by the cosmic beauty the makers presented.

The fights are imaginative and exciting and the visuals of the strange other worlds are stunning.But its greatest value lies in its telling of the story of an immature man growing into a true hero. This is a kind of male experience that dates back through history, but is a part of the best action films with a male protagonist. This is what makes the film satisfying beyond just a visual action experience.Most of the reviews of this film have been good, but the few negative ones seemed to be from people who didn't understand the hero's quest or were too caught up in a more narrow, politically-correct mind-set to see it.",14 May 2011," An entertaining epic that updates the hero's quest

I can now add ""Thor"" to the list of favorite comic-book films. I like how in ""Thor"" they use the Norse mythology but they put a cool twist to it. Another thing, Chris Hemsworth(Thor) is totally gorgeous!! I am also a fan of Anthony Hopkins and I thought he did a great job in this movie. The graphics are also AMAZING in this movie!! I love the way they made Asgard look,absolutely breathtaking!! I highly recommend ""Thor"" if you are a fan of the Marvel comics.

99,jonny-van,"Thor was without a doubt the Marvel hero I was most afraid to see take on his own movie. A hero who to non Marvel fans was relatively unheard and unknown of compared to the likes of Spiderman and Hulk. As a Marvel fan I feared how he could be portrayed, how he could be viewed as a believable God/Superhero. Could this be a standalone film or just a tie in needed for the Avengers film to work? When I saw this in the cinema I was blown away! On par with the standards of Iron Man and X men 2! Chris Hemsworth brings us a hero we love, root for and most of all believe in. On both acting and physique he makes the perfect Thor. Hiddleston is a wise choice for Loki and taking on Anthony Hopkins as Odin was a genius move. Whilst Kenneth Brannagh seemed a dangerous choice to direct a superhero film he delivers on all aspects and his knowledge of all elements of film are taken on board and used with some scenes almost Shakespearean.To this point Thor remains my favourite Marvel release yet. 10 stars from me.",20 April 2012," A Mighty Portrayal

It is as close to a perfect adventure movie as you can get. Superman has generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film. Spider-Man has generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character. TDK has generally held the title as most technically sound and highly rated superhero film.

I give it an 85 because there were some things they could improve on, but man was it awesome. I'd say Iron man is still #1, but CA is pretty dang close. It is par with Hulk and then comes Thor and IM 2. Yes I liked the Hulk, I couldn't figure out what fans didn't like about it, anyways another time. Great movie, I will for sure go see it again. I don't get why the critics are giving it bad reviews, I feel like they are now bias to comic book movies, or just don't understand what's going on in it. The only thing wrong with CA was that it wasn't 5 hours long, which makes sense, it was a little rushed, but whatever all the important pieces were there. It was great story telling, and man Chris Evans is Steve Rogers!!! The Red Skull was great too, an actual scary bad guy. And those of you who were worried, don't be there are Nazis and swastikas in it. It followed the comic almost perfectly, almost, you'll see what I mean, but I think for the movie universe it might just work out. The director did a perfect story telling job her, couldn't ask for anything better. I'd like to see some multiple emotional stories in a sequel as well as more bad guys.

I was wrong and I couldn't be more pleased. It's truly a stupendous movie regardless of genre.Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, Cap's creators mix everything so well. It leans away from dark but touches on it just enough. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and believable. It's truly better than most comic-book movies have ever delivered. So much of the humor works because of this and all the dramatic beats really click. Steve Rogers is so well written and displays true character establishment and development over the course of the film. Even the longing and then flirtation between Steve and Peggy has the undertow of lonely romantic longing and implications. What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that just about every scene packs real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable summer movie. Oh yeah, did I mention that Cap kicks butt and is loads of fun too?

This is not a film I would have chosen to go see - not my favorite genre - but my kids were dying to see it. After having had to deny them the opportunity to see several other superhero films due to the film ratings for language, sex, and violence, I was wary of this film. I knew nothing about Captain America whatsoever. So I did my typical research, determined the film passed my test as far as I could tell (never know with ratings these days), and I went to the theater hoping I would not be disappointed. I wasn't. My kids thought the the movie was fantastic, and I loved it as well, especially since it was free of the cheap raunchiness that afflicts so many movies these days. A great storyline, wonderful recreation of the 1940s, honorable characters, fun humor, nice cast of talented actors. Overall, a truly enjoyable film that was both exciting and uplifting, with - finally! - some great moral lessons and some patriotism (that was refreshing in this day and age.)

Not only was the performance of Chris Evans a current career high light, Hugo Weaving does not on the other hand disappoint portraying the a most evil antagonist. I do not see fit to name any other names, however in light of Hayley Atwells performance I think we will be seeing a lot more of her in Hollywood.As for the film its self, Excellent, Critics of this genre need to realize the genre that is being depicted through this movie has conventions and thats why we watch them.From batman to spider man these are the what make super hero movies great.We are seeing the re-invention of the medium through which super hero's are being portrayed and rightly so. The Graphic novel and comic book mediums, although still going somewhat strong lack the socioeconomic structure (aka they're not trendy enough thus don't make enough money) to be advertised to a younger audience.In turn the moral values these movies teach will not be forgotten, thats the point of marvel, its not about the powers, or the hero. It is about the individual and the relatability.-thats from Stan Lees mouth as well Which brings me back to Captin America, the never give up attitude that Americanism was so caught up on during the set era is ripe and depicted well through Steve Rogers character. Teaching us to rise up to a challenge, and to never back down from what we believe in no matter the cost.The action that is lusted for the moment you can smell the popcorn will loosen your grip on your drink and have you reeling in anticipation of what Captin America will do next.A great movie which i will be recommending to all my friends This film leaves me excited for the avengers and the other films the paramount/marvel franchises are about to unleash on the world =P",30 July 2011," Captin America, good to see you could make it on time.

Experience has shown me that when a movie is made about a Comic Book Hero, the hero comes across pretty ""Comic"" and unbelievable. Having read these books in my youth, I was looking forward to see what they would do with it. I was very pleased that they did not try to inject an anti USA message here.

Different film editing would have made this an Oscar contender for sure is the only weak point I could find. This film coming out when the ""Super Soldier"" programs that various governments are working on makes it timely and more believable.

It's the best big budget movie that I've seen this year. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining a cool plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, charisma, a dash of patriotism, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. This movie will surprise a lot of people with its heart while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of underdog Steve Rogers. His never say die attitude and heart of a champion makes this hero more interesting then most. Captain America delivers on every level and does so with great emotional moments and it's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.Everything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the best summer movie season in recent memory. It's certainly the best overall summer for superheroes. The cast is obviously stellar but that doesn't always mean greatness. (American Gangster, Wanted, Sphere, etc.) I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, Chris Evans himself delivers one of the greatest performances in a comic adaptation film EVER. Maybe it's because the character itself is one of the most complex and intriguing that any genre has to offer but that doesn't diminish just what a home run Evans has hit.

112,TheBlueSaint,"Most of the critical reviews of this film fault it for the very thing that makes it special. They criticize it for acting and plot when it's obvious what they really can't tolerate is the message. It's entertaining rather than dark; exciting rather than dismal and engrossing rather than self important. Unlike the common trend it portrays a hero that is self-sacrificing rather than self pitying. Who is more concerned with others than himself. This doesn't fit with the current fad for heroes who are borderline psychopaths as likely to snap and end the world as to save it. The people who hate this film are the ones who think a brooding, self hating Batman is ""realistic"" and avidly follow a meth-dealer's descent into violence and madness. Brave, honest and self-sacrificing don't carry the cool-cachet of brutal, psychotic and self-absorbed. This is a film with an actual hero rather than an anti-hero. Someone you wouldn't be afraid to find yourself alone with in an elevator.For some reason actual heroes offend certain people. They claim they're not ""real"" enough; they don't reflect the frailty, deceit and brutality of actual people. They seem to be insulted by a portrayal of a person who is more noble than they are. Who challenges their vision that somehow we're all corrupt if you look deeply enough. They claim that the movie is clichéd; as if the lonely hero sitting sullenly gazing over the city is somehow fresh and insightful. They criticize the acting as if Chris Evans' squeaky clean Captain America is somehow more contrived than Christian Bale's neurotic Batman and Hugo Weaving's Red Skull is more over-the-top than Heath Ledger's manic Joker. They're criticizing the medium but what unnerves them is the message. I wish I understood why.There is one other vein that runs through the critical reviews. It's too overtly American. As if that is by its very nature a flaw. They feel that Americans should forever dwell only on the mistakes of recent years and forget any achievements of the past. To begin and end all things with a spoken or unspoken apology for the very act of being American. This is as myopic as blind patriotism. There is no shame in highlighting the ideals towards which a great country should strive.But back to the film. If you want to feel exhilarated; to feel good about being alive when you're done viewing a film; if you want a film that has humor and soul as well as violence and mayhem watch Captain America. If you want to leave a film wondering whether simply being human is somehow a burden; as if it's all just a long solemn slog unto the grave watch another, more ""realistic"" hero film.",31 December 2013," A Superhero Film That Isn't Ashamed of the Hero.

I've noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. Either Cap stayed very close to its root origins or people are judging it as a film first. Whatever the reason, it seems most enjoyed it as much as I did. Visually it is a sight to behold and that goes for the special effects but also for the time period tone and war grit of the film itself. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on ""Raider of the Lost Ark"" action or the developmental down time. Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about? And here I thought Iron Man or X-Men raised the bar in terms of what we could expect from modern adaptations. While true, what's remarkable is that Captain America raises the bar on what we can expect from a blockbuster in general. It's certainly not just eye candy; it's an all around exceptional movie.

The special effects are excellent, and if you are looking for an exciting, fun movie to watch you need look no further.However, if you want a story with more depth, this movie also delivers on that level. It is the story of one brave man, not gifted physically, but given a second change, willing to fight to make a difference where he could in the world. It is of course a fictional story, but at its core I think resonates, as I think of the many people who have given their own lives sacrificially for others.Chris Evans, playing Steve Rodgers (Captain America), does a convincing job of playing a man who is ""weak"" outside, but made of iron inside. His adversary, Johann Schmidt (The Red Skull) is a bit over the top in his performance, but not so much as to become a campy villain. The supporting cast does a nice job, even if Tommy Lee Jones seems a bit wasted in a relatively small role with little opportunity to give his acting skills the workout they are certainly up to.The movie could be seen as somewhat of a setup for the Avengers movie, as ""Thor"" and other Marvel superhero movies have been. However, I think this movie stands alone very nicely, and the setup part of it is not distracting at all other than perhaps the brief closing sequence that might have been better relegated to after the credits.The movie is set in the 1940's and from what I know of the time seems to capture their atmosphere well. I did not think this a problem for today's audiences since the essence of the story has little to do with the time period and everything to do with heroism.

Without question, the makers of this movie went all the way in making it a satisfying experience for not just the fans but for the uninitiated as well. It's a fun yet an intelligent movie that actually works way above the level set up by previous comic adaptations.

I wish the fans of other films that couldn't compare to the Marvel films this summer would just get over it. Sure, Thor, X-Men and now Cap have outclassed everything else this summer by a ton but that's no reason to be defensive or even worried that they overshadowed your film. That's life.

I bought comics more for the artwork than the story, but the stories would help. There were quite a few good artists in the 70s and 80s -- today there are very few -- and they helped to expand my sketches. Along the way I became a fan of Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Batman, Spawn and Conan the Barbarian.In the 70s Richard Donner made the Superman movie. At that time superheroes were largely on cartoons or series (Wonder Woman, Superman, Batman and The Incredible Hulk). Casting Christopher Reeves was brilliant the the first big superhero movie became one of the greatest of all time. Since then many have tried and many have failed. Spiderman opened the door again with it's quality of movie. Iron Man and the Christian Bale Batman movies showed that you can make a great superhero movie. The sad part was that you had The Fantastic Four (below average), Iron Man II (awful), The X-Men (average--all 3), Wolverine (a dog), Daredevil (less than daring), Electra (the worse ever), Michael Keaton's Batman I and II (average), Val Kilmer's Batman (average), George Clooney's Batman (almost killed Batman entirely) and the Superman Returns bomb.Green Lantern and Thor hit the theaters this year in 3D and both were less than spectacular. It was disappointing that two of my favorite superheroes were portrayed so poorly.Now came Captain America. I was hoping it would at least be better than Green Lantern, but I was skeptical with the last couple of superhero movies. I was not a fan of Chris Evans in the role and I felt that may kill the movie. I watched Evans in the bad Fantastic Four and the god-awful The Losers and all he did was play a cocky smart-mouthed punk. This was not what Captain America was to folks.I was so pleasantly surprised. Captain America exceeded my expectations and was on the level with Iron Man I, Superman, and Batman Begins/The Dark Knight.

He grows in to the hero role and you grow to like and admire him as you watch, maybe moreso than any other Marvel hero. I know, that's saying a lot since that's what truly makes Marvel great. It's not superpowers but relatable pathos and depth of character. Well, Cap delivers all that and more. It all works remarkably well as they humanize Steve and draw you in to the story. First Avenger is not just a good comic book movie. It's a great movie period.The complexity, depth, heart, emotion and action are off the charts. I honestly can't believe we're going to see a better movie this summer and, for that matter the rest of the year. I totally agree with most of the film critics who are raving about it.

119,acolu7,"Yes I said it. I personally even enjoyed it more than Iron Man actually, because Captain America The First Avenger has much more to it than just great action sequences and a solid story. It has heart. The quiet confidence of star Chris Evans speaks the loudest without him even saying anything and ultimately, that's what makes this movie succeed more than anything else. I enjoyed Chris Evans performance so much in this film I kind of wish he had never played Johnny Storm from the Fantastic Four movies. He was just that good, and to me was born to play this role. Without a doubt he IS Captain America. The film is extremely well casted and Marvel may have just nailed their most frightening/menacing villain yet. Hugo Weaving plays the Red Skull who squares off against Captain America and who's motives tie into a previous Marvel Studio film. *hint hint.. Thor* This is also the very first Marvel Studio film without a rushed romance. The chemistry between Chris Evans and co-star Hayley Atwell oozes off screen and makes for Marvel Studios first believable romance. (I liked Thor's romance as well but compared to Captain America the romance in that felt too rushed) The movie really does a terrific job of making you feel for Steve Rogers before his transformation. I felt the skinny Steve scenes were the most meaningful and helped you to really connect with Steve after the transformation as well. The pacing of the movie is really well done. It never dragged once, and kept me interested and entertained the entire time. The action is also very fast-paced and slick, director Joe Johnston definitely knows how to work the camera around an action scene. The fights are very easy to distinguish and their are really no quick cuts or ""slow mo"" scenes (which is director Zack Synder's forte.) and I really appreciated that. Overall I would give Captain America the First Avenger a 5/5 I just absolutely loved this film and cannot wait to see it again. It captures the spirit of old adventure classics and you can definitely see a bit of an influence from ""The Rocketeer"" in this film. Go see it!

Not overblown, not a tough-guy, just a good man who wants to do right. I LOVED how he was portrayed. Major kudos to the writers and director.Overall, I think this is my favorite superhero movie to date. It slightly edges out ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Iron Man"" and ""Thor"".",23 July 2011," Fantastic superhero movie

121,meyoukangaroo,"I'd admit it, I had watched it a bit late, but this is by the far, next to Tower Heist in recent movies, as the better ones of cinema now. This is a pinnacle of the right medium thrown across the face of the expected general bland that is Hollywood entertainment at this point; where the biggest movie stars perform in mediocre films, and everything seems to be contemporary, stupid or depressing. But once in a while, someone a director or and actor or a writer comes a long, to reinstate at least some hope back in all that bland unoriginal theme, and in the right way. Captain America was a homage to the comic series, it was great, it had plenty of actions and even though it kept that relevantly typical marvel comic build like that of Spiderman where something extraordinary happens, it was made in the most rationalized means, and fitted into a nice framework of creativity and originality. That's the word - originality and ingenuity, - you don't get that often in Hollywood now- a-days, and this really slapped it on like well ridden material. A true homage, and even though my ""fellow"" viewers found it a bit ""unrealistic"" and the humor ""obvious/offbeat comic-relief"" they don't know what the movie competitors are, to truly know how much other movies now a days are off beat in humor and ""weird"", my fellow viewers are insane, and don't know what they're talking about. There were no boring bits, and it was funny and quirky all the way. And most of all it was GENUINE, - weirdness and offbeat humor are made splendid when like in the movie where the main character learns from the scientist that value of strength is what's important, - this movie shows how the value of the genuine is important, and that can triumph over occasional unrealistic marvel aspects and offbeat humour (if any) any time of any day in this current movie industry.",10 March 2012," Thumbs up my brotherend!

122,docdoink,"I can see why everyone is praising Captain America in some way. Cap manages to deliver a little bit of everything and does it with style and integrity. This extremely talented cast fit each character perfectly, both large and especially the smaller roles. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. The dialogue is witty and the humor works its way seamlessly in to the natural order of the story. The film certainly is smart but it's fun first and foremost. Comic book style slugfests are certainly part of the fun but are inserted as a vehicle for the story and not just to see CGI things explode. Things aren't blown up just for the sake of seeing them go boom. What makes Captain America as good as any Marvel film is the fact that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult. How many movies can pull that off? Like Thor and the Iron Man films, this is movie-making of the most entertaining order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. It makes anyone long for that Avengers film to be sure.I don't want to make any deep insinuations or start trouble but Captain America's depth of emotion and character combined with tremendous fun and action means this could very well be the best comic book movie produced this year. For a year that's this loaded, that's really saying something. It's superb in every way. I love the fact that the film sets up fine but it doesn't dwell in darkness or get bogged down the way a lot of origin films often do. It lays enough groundwork but then advances a kick butt story. There's no doubt, comic book or not, it's one of the better action/adventure movies in recent memory.",29 July 2011," One of the better action/adventure movies in recent memory!!!

This is my favorite film in MCU film it I think my number four favorite film in the MCU universe films I am not sure. It is a decent action film with pure badassery. Excellent performance from Robert Downey Jr. ,Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo,
Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg , Samuel L. Jackson. I love this movie to death I have enjoy it so much. We have Iron Man, Hawkeye, Captain America, Black Widow and Thor a superhero team in this movie fighting ultimate evil from outer space lead by Loki and his army Chitauri fleet launching an invasion on New York.Great direction from Joss Whedon he directed perfect ""The Avengers"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" we need Joss Whedon back because the Russo brothers are ruining the franchise of Avengers. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) was a great villain I absolutely enjoyed his character. I love the costume's design for the superhero team. I love the special effects CGI and designs for the Chitauri bad-ass action. Captain America is my ultimate favorite superhero he saves all civilians trapped in a building from Chitauri Army. He orders police officers to evacuate all the civilians a true hero.When Loki (Tom Hiddleston) enters earth from The Tesseract, an energy source of unknown potential, opens a portal through space carrying a strange spear with a blue glowing tip. With the spear he takes control of the minds of several SHIELD personnel, including Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and Agent Clint ""Hawkeye"" Barton (Jeremy Renner), to aid him in his getaway. With controlling mind of Dr. Erik Selvig he is building a device built that can open a portal to the Chitauri home world over Manhattan, summoning a Chitauri invasion. It is up to superhero team Avengers to stop Loki and his mad invasion recruited by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) director of the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. Before the team starts working together they have to learn to trust and depend on each other if they want to stop Loki.Great adaptation of MCU superhero team from the characters how they become the mighty defenders of the earth called ""The Avengers"". I love the theme song from Alan Silvestri who made a music score in the film. Great performance from Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury I love his so much. Justice League (2017) should have learn from this movie because ""The Avengers"" is a good superhero movie at least it is not boring movie like was Justice League at least I can get in to this movie with not been bored.Hulk smashes everything including best fight from Hulk and Thor. Captain America is a bad-ass while Iron Man is a hero saving New York and whole New York from alien invasion with the spear Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow closes the portal Chitauri world. I love the song played on the end of the credits Soundgarden - Live to Rise It is a good song in The Avengers I love it.
I love Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) so much in this movie she made a decent job as Black Widow and the actress to death and her character. Captain America is my favorite hero of all time Steve Rogers is a true hero to me in this movie.Decent movie, bad-ass action in this film I have no words, it is definitely my third favorite MCU Marvel superhero film.

126,krieg8814254,"I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies I've ever seen. It's almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It's not a two dimensional ""team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho."" Most don't like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work ""the other side of the fence"" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you're obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I'm just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that.

127,ivo-cobra8,"Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that. Mark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.The pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's. It was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.Admittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.The Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out. Marvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon. I have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films.

128,NORTHPOINTMJM,"If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie really did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film. I couldn't be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, there's the popcorn fun we were all expecting but there's also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well. It's truly a stupendous movie regardless of genre.Marvel did it, they pulled off the culmination of a master plan that's been taking shape for years. They deliver a movie the likes of which we've never seen before and as good of a film that's ever been made in its genre.There's a reason this grand of a movie has never been attempted before now. How do you fully flesh out, care about and establish this vast group and still deliver a fun, crisp and coherent story? It's extremely difficult to navigate that edge-of-your-seat excitement while at the same time caring about each one of the characters and their struggles. One of the most impressive aspects of The Avengers is that they managed to get each hero their time in the spotlight and their own character arc. Every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable intelligence and given room to shine.I loved that the stakes in this film are ridiculously high and the threat so impressive that there really is a need for these diverse characters to come together. That could have been a stumbling block in terms of story but it's treated just right. It's also a great idea that they chose to introduce all the characters to the audience as if you've never seen them before. Sure, the other films set up and give depth to each character but even if you missed their solo films, you'll still know and care about them in this movie.It's also wonderful that everything is as big as it should be. This truly is the comic book epic of our lifetime (the fanboy version of Gone With The Wind circa 1939 if you will) and it all shows up on screen. Everything looks GREAT and feels epic. The equipment (love that Helicarrier), the relationships, the stars, the characters themselves and the battles are all huge and as fully mesmerizing as they should be. There are scenes that are emotional and there are scenes that are going to make any audience member scream ""BADASS!"" and mean it.I'm serious when I say that the big, explosive moments are as grand as they should be but it's the smaller character moments in this film that really take it to another level. At this point, we've all seen how good some CG action can get but grounding it with a great story and with meaningful quieter moments is what makes a movie good. That's the ace up the Avengers sleeve. This is NOT some CGI video game movie. Cut out the action and I'd still want to see this movie. So, it's safe to say that they are replicating the comic book experience on the big screen. Years of depth coupled with spectacle and advanced fiction is a treat for non-comic book and comic book fans alike. That's is The Avengers greatest power... the ability to entertain all comers!",19 April 2012," They balanced everything masterfully. As Good As It Gets!!!

129,facebook-124-955845,"I'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiativein that short scene, the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye  (Jeremy Renner) as ""assembled"" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god  Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to ""hulk out"". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for  me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its  caliber.

132,alindsay-al,"After all the films leading to this one we were promised the Avengers on screen and this film gave us that big time. This film sees a group of big personalities having to come together and defeat a mad man and his army from enslaving humanity. One of the most important parts of the build up to this film was Robert Downey jnr's performance as Tony stark/iron man, and he is just as awesome in this film. His character grows in all these films but he is still the narcissist that we love. Also Chris Evans as captain America was really important as he is the leader and comes across as the moral compass of the whole film but he isn't boring which is great for the character. The rest of the performances are great as well, first of all is the recasting of Mark ruffalo as Bruce banner/hulk and he was the biggest surprise in this film. He was great in both roles and the hulk has absolutely never been better then this film. Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor and this guy is absolutely seriously movie star and makes this character a great character full of personality. Scarlett Johansson returns as black widow and she is sexy and tough while also proving that she is also the best female in these superhero films around. Samuel L Jackson is back as Nick fury and he is great as the character and squeezes the most he can out of this great character. The one member of the team that isn't really developed is Hawkeye, he isn't really himself for the most of the movie but even then the last battle he becomes great. What is important in a film like this is having a great villain and Tom hiddlestone as Loki definitely succeeds at that. He is just so fun to watch and you buy that he could pull off all this destruction. Sometimes simplicity is best for a story and this is one of those times, it has happened before that a group of combustible elements have to team up but this film gets the most out of it and adds real drama to the film. The script is the best part of the film and the dialogue between the characters is what makes this film so enjoyable to watch because it makes all the characters feel unique and there own personalities. The style of this film is great, the action is all enjoyable and the film looks great but I have to mention the show stealer that is the incredible hulk.

133,scotts863,"I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event.",21 April 2012," A Flat out Exceptional Movie Event. (Best Villain in Years!)

134,Allswell007,"I just loved Marvel's Avengers. I thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered! This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember when I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat. Example: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said for every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what makes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, GI Joe and even Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and delivers depth with its fun.I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years if not ever!",14 April 2012," Exceptional! Oh my God. Oh. My. God. My mind is blown.

Great Directing and writing from Joss Whedon too. The cinematography was stunning throughout the whole film.This is a fun action packed film for the whole family to enjoy just like the rest of the Marvel movies but better. The special effects by far are the best for any Marvel movie. The Hulk Looks so much more real. By the way The Hulk made the movie even better. Also, DO NOT SEE THE AVENGERS IN 3D! See the film because you will not be disappointed even if you are not that interested into superhero movies. It has a lot of humor and love, so again SEE IT!",12 April 2012," Great, GREAT FILM!!

136,Al1899,"After watching the film today, I decided to review this film because I am literally on the edge of my seat for the sequel and every time I wake up for university or for work, I view all three trailers and get even more excited and emotional for the film!I watched the film on 04/27/2012 when it was released in Scotland and for me to see all the heroes and supporting characters brought in from their respective films together into one film was dream come true for me. I always hoped for a Justice League film consisting of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (John Stewart), The Flash, Hawkgirl & J'onn J'onzz, but I have to admit that DC are rushing things for their cinematic universe. From the introduction to each hero to their developing relationships to the funny moments between each character and to the amazing visual affects, there is not a dull moment in this film! The Avengers is FANTASTIC! We know who the characters are and their origins developed from the preceding films - Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011) & Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen was extremely fun and boisterous. Many fans of the superhero genre want a balance of fighting, explosions as well as intelligent scenes and Joss Whedon and Zack Penn do just that with their vision and imagination. The scenes are entertaining and hilarious especially when the characters are interacting with one another during the film such as Captain America meeting Iron Man after the confrontation with Loki, Iron Man mocking Captain America and Thor, the chemistry with Bruce Banner is poetic in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier conference room and finally, the scene between Thor and the Hulk is hilarious especially when Thor is sucker punched by the Hulk. Also, the scene when Iron Man thrusts the energy onto the shield of Steve Rogers to annihilate a Chitauri fleet foreshadows events in Captain America 3 or better now known as Captain America: Civil War. In addition, it's a shame that Edward Norton didn't return as Bruce Banner/Hulk, but Mark Ruffalo nailed the scenes in his first film in the role bequeathed to him by the former. Ruffalo portrays Banner in a phlegmatic manner managing to control his impeccable rage only to easily let it out when in the Hulk mode, his performance is AMAZING!!! The best part of the movie for me would have to be the moment when Tony Stark as Iron Man introduces himself as a team player near the climax - after being lambasted by Steve Rogers/Captain America earlier - when he intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet destroying the mother ship. However, the stars of the film for me would have to be Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Hiddleston. Both actors are superb in their roles as Iron Man and Loki, respectively.Marvel and DC both have a variety of rich characters and even a brilliant number of story lines, however, in my eyes, Marvel will always be number one because they have implemented their films with careful planning and precision. In the end, when it comes to Marvel Cinematic Films, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness and we all know for a fact that Marvel will up their game and will ALWAYS deliver for their loyal fan base.",28 March 2015," The Avengers (04/27/2012)

137,j-pryde,"Although Marvel Pictures have always made curious appointments in regards to their feature film directors the results have been mostly solid, if not spectacular thus far. I certainly didn't expect Jon Faverau to deliver one of the best comic-book movies ever – Iron Man. If it wasn't for DC's own Billionaire playboy superhero would've champion Iron Man as the best flick in the genre. Yes I do rate Iron Man that highly. Spider-Man 1 & 2 were good but didn't exactly capture the essence of Peter Parker while Spider-Man 3 was a huge mess, not Mark Steven Johnson mess, but a mess nonetheless. Last year's motion picture debuts of Marvel staples Thor and Captain America were also very good, very faithful to their respective source material. Joe Johnston redeemed himself after a misguided attempt at bringing the Wolfman back to the silver screen, whereas Kenneth Branaghs Shakespeare sensitive's proved a stroke of genius in fitting Thor into Marvel's motion picture universe. To be honest I even enjoyed 2008's The Incredible Hulk after Ang Lee damn near killed the franchise.Even though Marvel Pictures has proved time and again to make the right decisions when producing a movie on its own, the hiring of Joss Whedon seemed like an odd choice. Of course Joss Whedon is the genius behind TV-cult hits like Buffy, Angel and Firefly but his only foray into directing was 2005's Serenity. Managing all those superstar egos, handling multiple character arcs, dealing with several multimillion dollar franchises and making everyone happy from top brass executive down to the hardcore fanboys – to be honest, I wouldn't have entrusted him with a fraction of the $200-million-plus budget for The Avengers. Thus far only two directors have managed to pull off the impossible and accomodated several superheroes in a single movie – Bryan Singer (X-Men & X2) and Matthew Vaughn (X-Men First Class) while Brett Ratner ruined X-Men 3 with his unfocused direction. At first I thought Joss Whedon would do an even more terrible job than the latter, considering that Ratner had more filmmaking experience than Whedon at the time of filming X3. But nothing could be further from the truth. Joss Whedon is the MASTER, with a captial M.Let me say it out loud: JOSS WHEDON IS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE GOD. Unlike Ratner he actually cares about the characters and their development throughout the movie. You think Tony Stark would just waltz through the movie and roll over every other character? You are wrong. Though Robert Downey Jr. is in top form as he always is when he dons the Iron Man suit, the other characters are far from underdeveloped and don't crumble under the pressure of his larger-than-life persona. If anything it's the Hulk that absolutely steals the show. That said, I think we have found the definitive Bruce Banner, Mark Ruffalo, he absolutely owns the role. He is the Hulk and we finally got the Hulk we deserved. Everybody brings their A-game and every character gets a fair amount of screen time. I can't find any flaw in this movie. Of course the special effects are spectacular but it's the dialogue that won me over. Really. Each character in this movie has at least one or two memorable lines – not just Tony Stark. When you watch the Avengers make sure you listen to the dialogue carefully – I've never heard dialogue this witty in any comic movie, and I've watched my fair share. Joss Whedon you are the freaking man. They said it was impossible to accommodate this many characters in a single movie – they were wrong. From now on everyone will reference this movie whenever multiple larger-than-life figures are thrown into one supersized extravaganza – Yeah I'm slamming the last two Transformers flicks. I guarantee Joss Whedon would've done justice to the franchise. After watching the Avengers everything that bears the name of Joss Whedon is a must-see for me now. Final verdict: 10 out of 10. This movie is Iron Man on steroids. Go watch that movie!!!",25 April 2012," Marvel's Avengers: Joss Whedon I'm officially your number 1 Fanboy and a believer

138,rachel-673-19946,"This, friends, is the comic book movie that all other comic book movies wish they could be. It's the pinnacle, the ultimate, the surely unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre, a grand adventure full of humor, action, tension, fan service and an undeniable pathos. For anyone fearing that all the hype – years and years worth of hype – might cheapen or otherwise overshadow the final outcome, you may at last be at ease. Because the JOSS WHEDON! AVENGERS MOVIE! is exactly as good as we all hoped it could be.Maybe even better.The Avengers, of course, are a superhero team made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Other heroes have come and gone amongst this happy few, in comic form, but here all you need to know is that this film serves as kind of a sequel to previous Marvel movies IRON MAN(both 1 and 2), THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America, bringing the billionaire Tony Stark, the scientist Bruce Banner, the demigod Thor and the recently defrosted World War II veteran Steve Rogers together to fight against an invading alien threat, alongside spies Clint Barton (Jeremy Denner) and Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) and under the auspices of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.Man, it's awesome. AWE. SOME.Oh, it's by no means a perfect film. Whedon is perhaps just a shade too in love with S.H.I.E.L.D technology, and the weight of portent which is given to some truly innocuous lines – especially the final line – feels a little off-kilter. Flashing up a computer image of Natalie Portman's Jane (Thor's love interest from his movie) felt a little like an apology, and the shadowy government hacks who attempt to control Nick Fury are by-the-numbers backroom power players of the Cigarette Smoking Man-school, ruthless and annoyingly cliché.Everything else, though? Simply, outstandingly, without a shadow of a doubt incredible.Just for fun, let's talk acting. All our returning superheroes reprise their roles with ease, Downey Jr. once again a delight as the arrogant billionaire Stark and Evans stoic and earnest as the displaced Cap. The award for Most Improved has to go to Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor is given a chance to rock some deadpan wit here, and rock it he surprisingly does. Johansson, of course, is gorgeous and ass-kicking as ever in her Black Widow leather, but is happily also given new levels of intriguing backstory at which to hint and play out, and her friend Hawkeye is given somewhat more to do here than he was allowed in Thor, Jeremy Renner's relaxed performance once again worthy of my beloved marksman's bow and arrow. Clark Gregg's mild-mannered Agent Coulson is adorable in his hero worship; meanwhile our main antagonist in this film is Loki, Thor's resentful trickster brother once again played with consummate creepy cool by Tom Hiddleston.Oh, and hello again Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts! Aren't you funny and great?Of the newcomers, I will admit to having had some reservations about Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, as I had been a true devotee of Edward Norton's turn in the role, but I am big enough to admit when I am wrong: he was terrific here as the mousey, mild-mannered science guy with a chip on his shoulder, and the uses to which his Hulk was put throughout the course of this movie have almost entirely changed my mind about his place in the Marvel Universe. It was that good. Elsewhere, How I Met Your Mother's Cobie Smulders, as an agent of S. H. I. E. L. D., did a lot with a little – enough to hope we see more of her lithe and loyal lieutenant character in AVENGERS 2.Indeed, after a rollicking, outrageous, hilarious outing like this one, who wouldn't already be eagerly awaiting a sequel? It is, unequivocally, the best comic book movie I have ever seen (and I've seen, well, all of them). More than that, it is my favorite movie so far this year – whew! I was so hoping BATTLESHIP wouldn't continue to hold that title for too much longer – and one I cannot wait to see again.Avengers assemble, they say? Audience assemble, I say! And assemble, and assemble, and assemble again(And make sure you stay through the credits for the now-expected next-movie teaser Buffy and Angel fans will be particularly happy, even if they don't quite get the somewhat obscure comic-y reference)-- This review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine - www.geekspeakmagazine.com",27 April 2012," Best.

139,billygoat1071,"The Avengers movie must be a dream come true to everyone. Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen. While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.Our modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.Maybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.There are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer.

140,maverick-352-622235,"The wait for this movie has been excruciatingly long, ever since we saw the preview that was attached to Captain America. Here's what I thought of the movie when I caught the premiere.You get the best of Joss Whedon and that is quite a lot:1. Black Widow is no longer just a piece of eye-candy. Did you seriously expect the creator of Buffy to just let his female characters stand around looking pretty? She kicks ass and how! (Yes, and it's about time!)2. For all the newbies out there that haven't watched some or all of the previous movies, the rest of the characters are thoroughly fleshed out. You get a long explanation about what they have been up to since their story last ended. So, it's possible that the first half may be a tad slow for the die-hard fans, but the second half more than makes up for it. Also, for what it's worth, isn't it better to know what the characters have been doing all this while, before they get down to some serious action?3. The post-credits scene. Oh My God! There is no point, whatsoever, in going to watch the movie if you don't wait for it. You simply HAVE to see it. 4. On a side-note, if you're relatively new to the Marvel universe, you must see The Superhero Squad Show (Yes, it's a cartoon, and no, it's not a very serious one either. But looking past all that, it's a serious refresher course in everything Marvel) before the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, as it really helps you understand the characters. I wouldn't have understood the importance of the post- credits scene without it. 5. The fight sequences (the gist of which we all saw over and over again at Comic-Con!) finally makes it look like we are watching a superhero movie. It's not one until some old-fashioned ka-pow!6. And yes, there are many scenes which are a fanboy's (or girl's) most awesome-est dream come alive!You also, however, get the worst of Whedon, which I admit, I pretty much dreaded. I won't say what it is, as it will spoil it for you, but it's really very obvious if you've seen anything of Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (my opinion may not, however, be accurate, as some might argue that what we've seen is actually, his best) Whatever the general consensus, there is no doubt that Whedon gives his best shot at leaving his mark in the Marvel 'verse (!) and his best is pretty darn good!If I simply HAVE to find flaws in the movie, the only one I can think of right now is that some important Avengers - Ant-Man, Wasp, Black Panther and Vision - are nowhere to be seen. Black Widow was the only token female in this all-testosterone group, so Wasp would have been a welcome addition, as the scales would not be so unbalanced.The Avengers works because underneath all the larger-than-life heroes with their huge egos, their actions and emotions are just human enough to be believable. Things do not just fall in place - everybody does not magically get along with each other and fight away to glory - they had to work hard to make it happen. And that, is this movie's biggest USP.All-in-all, go watch the movie, if not on the first day, then at least some other time for as long as it's on in the theaters. Your first glimpse of this movie just HAS to be on the big screen.",24 April 2012," A Marvel-ous experience

141,sacflyzone,"Yep, Marvel has done it again but this time to the max! You can rest assured that Avengers is an absolutely amazing movie. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. (Sony pooping on Ghost Rider again this very year is a great reminder of that) Avengers is, without a doubt, their best effort yet! Personally, I think they set the bar leading up to this movie and they just clean blew the bar in to orbit with this movie.Avengers really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. They along with a select few others reinvented epic adventure as this century began by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Nolan did this for Batman and Raimi for Spider-Man. They pulled it off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them. Favreau, Branagh and Johnston did similar good work for Marvel leading up to this gem. Now, Joss Whedon not only continues that tone but adds to the work that's come before. It's like the ultimate team work and Whedon brings it all home and all together perfectly. Like the great films of the past, he grounds the action and the superhero concept in firm reality. The humor and acknowledging the absurd nature of everything we see adds the perfect flavor. Yet, all the character depth and relationship nuances are fleshed out well as with any other good film.I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Avengers delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt one of my top 10 movies of 2012, quite possibly THE best regardless of genre. I don't see anything changing that for the rest of the year. This movie is just that good",16 April 2012," Beyond Excellent. Avengers Hits At The Highest Level!

142,sanddragon939,"From the moment Samuel L Jackson walked in during the post-credits scene of 'Iron Man' four years ago, talking about the 'Avengers Initiative', the whole world has waited for this epic assemblage of some of Marvel's greatest icons! Well, four years and five films later, the Avengers have finally assembled...and, as expected, it was with a wave of sheer awesomeness!Unlike the previous 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' films, 'The Avengers' isn't really into complex plotting here. The premise is simple-Loki, the Asgardian 'God', seeks to facilitate the invasion of Earth by an alien race...and Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD, responds by activating the 'Avengers Initiative', bringing together armored hero Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. reprising the character for the third time), Loki's 'brother' and Asgardian warrior Thor (Chris Helmsworth), the living legend and man out of time Captain America (Chris Evans), gamma radiations expert Dr. Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego the 'Hulk' (both played to perfection by Mark Ruffalo, following in the footsteps of Edward Norton) and clandestine operatives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). What follows is the usual hero vs. villain fare...albeit on a scale about a BILLION times larger than that of, say, 'Spiderman'. Indeed, one of the greatest moments in the film is a single shot that sweeps across New York City, taken in the battles of each of the six Avengers across the breadth of the Big Apple...a testament to the sheer scale and scope of not only the film itself, but the threat faced by the heroes in-universe.Action and spectacles aside, 'The Avengers' real strength lies in the characterizations of the core characters. Downey Jr. turns in another memorable performance as Tony Stark which was to be expected, and Tom Hiddleton brilliantly essays the megalomaniacal God Loki...but it is newcomer (to the Marvel movie-verse) Mark Ruffalo who really stands out in his dual performance as both scientific genius Bruce Banner and the rampaging Hulk. Ruffalo brings a level of depth to the character, and his inner struggles, which was not immediately evident in performances by previous actors. His Banner is not so much a man on the run from the monster within as he is a man who is starting to learn to accept the monster and use it as a force for good. Samuel L Jackson really gets to shine here as Nick Fury, after his cameos in previous films.On a parting note, there has been an unfortunate tendency, for months, on message boards, blogs and forums across the Internet, to create some kind of a 'competition' between The Avengers and Nolan's upcoming epic, The Dark Knight Rises. Having seen the former, I can safely say that such comparisons are totally uncalled for. The Avengers is not aiming to surpass The Dark Knight Rises any more than Star Wars was aiming to surpass The Godfather. They are two totally different films, belonging to different genres and (literally) whole different universes, and as fans, we need to respect that above all else and enjoy all masterpieces on their own merits!",27 April 2012," Avengers: An Assembly of Sheer Awesomeness!!!

But after seeing the Marvel movie, Captain America: the first Avenger, Thor and Incredible hulk- I thought that the movie would be not as good as the hype it carried for so many years. But still due to Robert downey jr. i wanted to see this film. OK, i admit it, i was blown away by the movie in terms of Action, and of course Humor. Director Joss Whedon, directed this movie so BRILLIANTLY, that there are very little or NO flaws. Sufficient Screen time has been provided for each of the SUPERHEROES. but the Mighty guys, Iron man(RDJ) and the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) steal the show. Thor(Chris Hemsworth) was too, brilliant. In this movie, you'll see more of Captain America(Chris Evans) than his solo movie, which is really great. AND, Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson) kicks the ass off whoever she fights with. Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) is not at all Underused, his Powers were shown superbly. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) was great with his Initiative. And here it is, the main villain, Loki(Tom Hiddleston), steals the show with his mischievous and No-worries personality, he fits into the role perfectly. On the Whole, the cast were perfect, with each of them fitting into the characters with ease.The humor and witty one liners are splendid. Don't expect it to be DARK with no humor like the Dark knight, instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the film in the auditorium. Many people have started comparing Avengers with The dark knight, but what I SAY is these two are COMPLETELY different type of film, and comparing the two is not justified. Still if you compare, Avengers is better than Dark knight. Due to the reason that Avengers can be enjoyed by each and every person, it has action and Humor, both at equal Quantities.As for iron man, Robert downey jr IS Iron man, no other person can do that role so perfectly. Unfortunately, RDJ is about to leave the franchise after IRON MAN 3, i request the iron man fans to please him not to leave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films, including AVENGERS 2. :)I will ensure to each and every person who is reading this that, this film will never disappoint you, not even a moment. 100%. :) Go watch it without doubt.

To understand the Avenger's movie it's really important that you've seen all previous Ironman, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America's movies. As the avenger's give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the avengers empty headed about hero's history will be foolish. The Avenger's brings back our beloved Marvel's heroes Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury. Each hero's journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies. Now, The Avenger's stands strong in every department, from direction, production and performances. It won't be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes. The humor, action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous Marvel movies combined. The credit goes to generous brain of Joss Whedon. He brings out something very special out of each superhero. The interaction between all superheroes is something we don't see often, they tease, make fun and even fight with each other. Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman) is great as always. He brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is truly a god of thunder. His entry is as Big as Thor's entry should be, it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him. Chris Evens (Captain America) is indeed the ultimate American Hero, he got the charm and personality of a true America hero. Some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to Mark Ruffalo (The Incredible Hulk). For the first time we see some humor in the actions of Hulk, he is just not a fury green monster this time around. besides Hulk, the biggest surprise is Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), we have seen the part of her in Ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of Black Widow. She is absolutely stunning and fantastic. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is good and I hope to see him someday with Black Widow. They had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson the S.H.E.I.L.D are fun to watch. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is superb, he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in Thor, he has out done himself again. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) appearance is appreciated and I would have loved to see Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) in it too.

Every one of the superheroes gets their moment in the sun. And of course, there's Scarlett's character Black Widow. YUM! I'm giving the movie 10/10 (2D HD version) because it's so entertaining and it fulfilled all my expectations. You won't be disappointed.As far as the format goes though, stick with HD, there wasn't any real 3D moments. If you are hugely into your 3D experience, think twice before paying the extra, there wasn't any stand out 3D moments, but lots of out of focus backgrounds which kinda wasted the small fortune that must have been spent on production.

This is something what has NEVER been done before & Marvel has got there finger on the pulse. In 1998, a minor marvel character featuring a human/vampire hybrid made it way to the big screen. In 2000, a group of mutants evolved into the box office. In 2002, was the year of the Spider.After Daredevil, Hulk (Ang Lee), The Punisher, Elektra, Man-Thing, Fantastic Four & Ghost Rider, Marvel Studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures & the funding will come from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. The result led to the creation of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". Sounds cool, right? It was. No, really, It F***in' was. Iron Man made its motion picture debut, The Hulk got rebooted, Thor & Captain America have ""FINALLY"" got the Big screen treatment. Then came a huge shift in the Marvel universe.... Marvel Entertainment is now owned by Mickey Mouse.Amazing. Disney let go the Power Rangers franchise & bought Marvel.But after everything from comics to TV & film Marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as a company & knowing the fact that the biggest supporters (including me) are the fans. That is why they CAN NOT Disappoint us. Yeah, we complain about story lines, costumes & special effects, But if they stay true to the comics, the films would have done its justice. But i know deep down, Marvel Studios will always put out films & stay close to the material. So, what i've said earlier, was it worth the wait? Yes. Yes it was ""definitely"" worth it.Marvel Studios, the cast & crew of The Avengers did an amazing job & on the Marvel Cinematic Universe & i can't wait to see what comes next.Now if DC & Warner Bros. step their game up, we would like to see the Justice League into the big screen.",13 May 2012," Spectacular & Historic

148,A_Different_Drummer,"As a reviewer, I don't mess up often but, just like the line where Stark is ribbing Loki, sometimes even an IMDb top reviewer can have performance issues.My first view, I was annoyed that so much time was spent on backstory and it took an hour to get the ball rolling. Although in fairness once this story starts to move in the second hour, it MOVES.By my third viewing I could see the issue. I grew up with these characters and I had expectations. The expectations were incorrect, I now know, because those expectations were the reason the Marvel library was such a mess before the arrival of the Whedon Bros.So what Joss did was analyzed what was not working in past Marvel films then de-constructed the Avengers story, then build a film which could act as a base for future sequels, wit ha solid foundation.And wrote a script to die for. By the third time around I was actually listening to the film instead of just watching, and boy can that guy write.Like the line I posted as the title of this review. It took me 3 viewings to catch it. It is sly, it is sexual, and it is totally easy to overlook in all the action. But I was on the floor laughing.So there you go, it is fun, action packed (last hour), written at an Oscar level, the characters are perfectly cast (except the Nick Fury I grew up with was Caucasion, but I guess no one remembers) and, to keep the suits happy, not only made a bundle on its own but launched a new franchise.So that's a 10***********************************************ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLIND -- ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLINDJust watched this for the 8th time and want to update my review. As of this year (2017) this is, at the same time, one of the best ""action"" films in the history of the medium and one of the best scripts in the history of action films. I believe Joss received only one award for the screenplay, which is a pity, because it shows that the industry simply does not respect this genre. The little twists and turns that hold viewer attention like glue (""I'M ALWAYS ANGRY"" ""PUNY GOD"") are a Whedon trademark, and massively under-appreciated. I will also suggest that nothing with the Marvel brand that has arrived since Avengers I has been this good -- and I am including all their TV and other off-cable projects in that comment. The only flaw, and I mean the ONLY one, is that the close of this film sets an entire armada of ""politically correct"" followups having to do with the public blaming superheroes ... for being superheroes.

149,dee.reid,"As you well know by now, ""The Avengers"" is a large-scale superhero film that was four years in the making, with no less than four individual - yet inter-connected superhero films - feeding into this film's overall story. Joss ""Firefly"" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets ""The Avengers"" many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind.

151,MovieSonic,"It took me ages to watch this because of all the conflicting reviews. I thought it was going to be as bad/boring as Terminator Salvation or The Dark Knight Rises.This film was fantastic! Easily the best of the Iron Mans (although the first will always be 'the best', this one is repeat-watch-worthy).Now that I know how awesome this film is, I think the negative reviews make more sense: they seem to focus on things like 'but the bad guy isn't the same as the comic' or 'that's not believable' etc. so let's ignore those because that's just irrelevant. The film can still be good without sticking 100% to the comics! I can't believe some people complain about the realism when we're dealing with magic and flying iron man suits but okay, let's mark the film down because the hero didn't break his back quite enough in that scene?! I've given this a ten because the story progresses brilliantly, there are so many extra scenes included that you would normally expect to be edited out to keep the running time down but the fact that they're left in means the film has a well-rounded feel to it. Contrary to some opinions, I like that the woman has the chance to save the day instead of 'just' being eye-candy (Gwyneth wears the most amazing white office power-suit ever; congrats to the designer), it is a bit patronising to just have one scene of saving the day but it's better than nothing. One of the bad guys (Guy Pearce) is building a great profile for himself as being someone to watch out for as he might just steal the show! This film had it all, yes there's a cute kid, but this is Iron Man so it never gets cheesy and actually there are some hilarious scenes between Robert Downey Jr and the kid. There's loads of humour and the action is great.Everyone gets just the right amount of screen time in my opinion and I'm actually going to watch this again which is rare for me.10/10 as it's an excellent film - not perfect but excellent.",10 December 2013," Excellent comic action film; watch it!

So, they went in a unique, deeper and more powerful direction. Sure there are stunning action sequences but everything is in context of a greater theme and the entire story. They absolutely played this one just right. They let The Avengers sit on its own and didn't do anything but feed off the momentum and actions of that film. Everything here is focused on Tony Stark and his immediate universe. Avengers 2 is the last thing on anyone's mind watching this and, as much as I loved Avengers, that's a good thing. Everything needs to kind of re-set and take a breath. This movie is NOT concerned with being connected to anything larger or having Nick Fury come in and solve or oversee anything. The events in The Avengers are addressed but only felt as to their effect on Tony's psyche. This movie is about Tony Stark's journey after we've seen him last.

The finale here may be the best action scene of the year and the story points that lead to it are handled exquisitely. I'm so glad Marvel learned from the last two films in that regard. The ending battles in both Iron Man movies should have been longer. Here, the whole third act is intense and completely compelling without crossing in to video game action type territory.Overall, I simply adored everything about this movie. I did enjoy the original Iron Man a ton because it was refreshing and new. What's amazing is that they managed to almost re-invent the character here and deliver something fresh again.

It has rekindled the spark of a teenager trapped in the shell of a cynical adult movie goer.In a race that began in 2008 to be crowned Hollywood's Coolest and Most Awesome Superhero Movie, the score is now 3-1 with Iron Man on a two- point lead. The screenplay, co-written between Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout) and Drew Pearce is cleverly penned and packs the right punch for an action movie. By drumming up the significance of Tony Stark's development from previous films (The Avengers, Iron Man 1 & 2) without losing grip of dramatic unity as a whole; Shane Black (also the film's director) conceptualized a heroically simple, winning formula.Another satisfying aspect of Iron Man 3 (and this converts to audience payoff at the end of 130 minutes), is the sweet simple fact that narrative does not detain viewers with unnecessary exposition and scenes. The big bad guys waste no time playing mind-games for the sake of delaying a final showdown, thus one-upping other blockbusters where it counts. Ergo, no shortchanging and an effortlessly fluid plot.Things kick off with a flashback to 1999 during pre-Iron Man days, establishing Tony Stark's first meeting with future adversary — a then crippled scientist named Aldrich Killian. Desperate for resources from Stark Industries to develop experimental virus ""Extremis"" (yet turned away so unceremoniously), sets off rising malevolence from Killian (played by the unforgettable Guy Pearce, even more loathsome here than when he was hateful Charlie Rakes in Lawless). There's also brazen, immediate threat from a grim terrorist leader (Ben Kingsley's prowess and versatility in full glory here as both The Mandarin and Trevor Slattery) — bent on blowing up America at whatever cost necessary. And for what it's worth, I like the spin on Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow) damsel-in-distress anticipated — compelling touch to an otherwise archetypal character.To further inject urgency in the conflict, Tony Stark wrestles with the aftermath of New York (from The Avengers) and taunts The Mandarin on national TV, further exacerbating his wrath. A strike against Stark's mansion hatches a loosely comedic, coming-of-age with 10 year old Harley — it is here that leading man Robert Downey Jr. ingratiates himself as one of the best personality actors in Hollywood — incensed with moral rage at the right moments, oozing unsentimental smooth in others.I had fun spotting flashes of nostalgia in favorite superhero moments (Spiderman, Superman, Batman and even Transformers) throughout the show as well, and still can't believe they destroyed a fine looking limited edition Dora the Explorer digital watch.

Great acting by Downey Jr. as usual. He keeps true to the brilliant, egotistical but moral Tony Stark, now trying to cope without much success with all that happened during The Avengers (like the fact that there are aliens). Many more innovations to the Iron Man suits in this one since Stark uses that as a diversion from his troubles. Kingsley was probably underused but acted his part well, as did Paltrow and Guy Pearce. The action scenes were all non-routine, brilliant and well executed and were plenty. Jarvis kicks ass like always. The plot I felt was quite good and not run of the mill at least as far as action flicks go. There was a good amount of emotional depth to the characters and their motives as well as a nice banter between Stark and some random kid he meets and a nice bit of comedy throughout the movie along with a twist in the middle and a few nice surprises here and there.

Audiences have already come to expect such witty and self-referential dialogue from the the great writer Shane Black. Who is Shane Black, you ask? Well, you may not know him but you have certainly seen a lot of his films. This man is responsible for the greatness and awesomeness of the Lethal Weapon franchise, the wise- cracking Bruce Willis in The Last Boy Scout or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ( which also stars Robert Downey Jr.)Iron Man 3 was marketed as a story where Tony Stark would meet an opponent that would break him physically and mentally. It all looked very dark and gloomy. I'm glad to say that the end result is far from a dark and gritty movie. It is actually the exact opposite. This film is just as funny and action packed as the previous Iron Man films. The main difference is that this film has taken completely different approach than any other Marvel movie. This film isn't just your typical superhero has to fight a new enemy and in the end he wins story. This is a detective story, where our favorite billionaire, playboy philanthropist in his battle against The Mandarin is forced to go on a full-tilt investigation, revisiting crime scenes, digging through evidence and even interviewing witnesses. More than just being a detective story, what makes it a Shane Black detective story is the connections to the classic noir. Tony Stark is experiencing his darkest and toughest days due to post-traumatic stress from the Battle of New York (although in The Avengers he was fine, wise-cracking and joking around), he loses his home, his hunt for The Mandarin takes him through all kinds of crazy reveals and plot twists. There's even great voice-over narration just in the likes of Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. You get more Tony Stark than Iron Man. Which doesn't mean that there is less action. No, you get plenty of action scenes just most of them are Tony being out of the suit.Robert Downey Jr. has now become the living embodiment of Tony Stark. When you think of Downey, the first character you associate with him Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is just so believable in this role. I can't imagine any other actor in this role, it just wouldn't be such fun. Gwyneth Paltrow finally gets some action scenes. The banter between Downey's Stark and Paltrow's Pepper isn't that funny and light-hearted as in the previous films. Their conversations are now more serious since they are in relationship. Don Cheadle doesn't get much screen time as Col. Rhodes but this is the funnest his character has ever been. Shane Black establishes this Lethal-Waponesque relationship between him and Tony. Ben Kingsley, well, without spoiling anything you have never seen him like this. Few years ago Guy Pearce has started playing villains and bad guys. Well, I can't complain about him he is great as always but I would just want to see him once in a while as the good guy, that's all.Brian Tyler's score is much more darker but also much more melodic. Finally we get Iron Man's heroic theme which is truly kick-ass and great to listen to. Iron Man 3 is not the superhero film I was expecting but that doesn't mean it is a bad thing. I'm glad that all those trailers, clips and TV spots didn't ruin the film. I was a lot surprised at all the stuff happening in the film. This film is also great Christmas movie. Black explains why Iron Man 3 (just as lot of his other films are set at Christmas:""It's a time of reckoning for a lot of people, when you take stock of how you got to where you are now and lonely people are lonelier at Christmas and you tend to notice things more acutely.

But I guess it's how human natures are. Whenever there's nothing from out there, we kill each other...The ending, well, don't want to ruin y'all surprise, but it was definitely a bit sad to me.

Some people think it is awful but I can recommend it to everybody. It is a spectacular film because it's not dull, slow and predictable. So, I suggest you to watch it.

The movie had its funny moments here and there, and the action is great! Love the action in this movie, it is pretty intense, and had my hands covering my mouth on some parts. I think that the average person would be pretty entertained. But i would compare it to The Avengers, and the Avengers was pretty remarkable.

I do need to see it again. In terms of pure enjoy-ability, I put it top 3 of all sequels that I have enjoyed.What I really liked...-Every single character gets a moment to shine and every single actor cast in these parts are perfect. -The comedy is perfect. It's such a fine balance overall and everything works because it's very subtle and fits in with certain circumstances. -Some very tender emotional scenes. I won't spoil anything with specifics. -Some superb action and what could very well be award winning special effects. -All characters interactions are great and handled very well. This is a fantasy story that really cares about character first and it shows all the way through. Even Natalie Portman's Jane feel more fleshed out than she did in the original film. -The set pieces and other realms talked about in the first are seen here and are beautiful and well done. Asgard was even better believe it or not. -The mid-credit and end credit scenes, both cool. Make sure you stay for both.Marvel hit a pure home run with this endeavor. This film works because of the great cast and the fact that they took this subject matter seriously but remember to have fun. Chris Hemsworth was again perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",30 October 2013," Pure Enjoyment!

176,newtonpost,"Just got back from seeing this and thought I'd put in my thoughts.This is by far the most intricate and thoughtful of the Marvel films to date, with a great story and some superb performances, particularly Hiddleston's as Loki. The characters from previous Asgard related outings are there, but thanks to some good writing, are more 3 dimensional and therefore, interesting. This is one of the few films that would have benefited from an extra 15 minutes or so to explore further the motivations of the key protagonists. There is plenty of large scale action, as well as some laugh out loud humorous moments that help to keep this kicking along.I am both surprised and delighted that this is not only the best superhero movie to date, (even eclipsing Spider-Man 2), but currently the best movie I've seen this year.Don't miss this!",30 October 2013," Well, that was a surprise

The effects are wonderful and it is indeed a very funny and a very moving movie in places. I'm happy to report that neither factor is overused or gets in the way of the feel or story. It's the right amount of humor and right amount of angst. Cinematography is great and the score is amazing. Whoever scored this film should do so for the rest of the Marvel movies in my opinion.I knew they would nail the pathos but was pleasantly surprised by the creative fight sequences. They are phenomenal. Not overly long but when they rage, THEY RAGE. Also, Kurse can rival the Hulk in terms of scary power. He was better utilized than the Destroyer was in the first film. Loki is the scene stealer that was all hoped to see! Jane and Sif add more than eye candy but you would expect no less from Marvel. Hemsworth has cemented his legend as Thor with this effort. My only real disappointed is a minor one. They didn't really show the nine realms in any real detail. It seemed a cop out that hey're just open landscapes.

It really does appeal to all of your movie viewing skills. It's very artistic and you would expect no less from a director that crafted Game of Thrones. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would've thought. The pacing was perfect as is the indirect link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can't wait to see what Captain America brings us in his sequel.Also, I absolutely love the character of Loki because there was so much texture to the character. He's the perfect Marvel villain. He was complex but with a tinge of madness mixed in and perfectly written for the film. The rationale for what he does and how he behaves is masterful. I truly loved how Loki was written and portrayed. Then again, I honestly can say that about all the main characters. Thor and Jane really are allowed to shine here as well.My main critique after watching the first film was the instance romance between Jane and Thor. After watching this movie, you buy the love at first sight scenario boosted by the situational intrigue. This time around, the pace of the film really worked well. I can't remember a film that grabs you like they do right off the bat and never lets go but does it with intelligence and heart.

People love to complain about this movie *SPOILER* (DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM) The reason Thor and many others shift through one realm into the next is due to a Once in 5,000 Years event called The Convergence, where all Nine Realms line up, causing energy and matter to be able to pass realm to realm as though through a door. Some people can't grasp this and therefore, due to their sloping foreheads, will never grasp this concept.

195,Bruce722,"Thor: The Dark World is definitely one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. The cast, led by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, did a great job once again. Supporting actors Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, and so many more really are amazing. I've heard a lot of complaints about the pace being too quick and difficult to keep up with. My response? Don't take stupid people to see the movie. I honestly don't see how anyone would have trouble keeping up with the pace of the film. I thought the plot development was actually one of the stronger parts of the film. Another strong element was the humor. Like the first installment, there was a lot of situational humor. However, this movie took it to an entirely new level and didn't feel forced and out of place. Most of this is thanks to the aforementioned Kat Dennings and her unique comedic flair. Also, watch for the Captain America cameo for maybe the most humorous scene in the film. The action sequences were up to par with the rest of the movies, meaning they were epic. Natalie Portman is as breathtaking as ever and the rest of the supporting cast adds a combination of depth and humor. The only negative in the movie, and I'm really not sure if it's a fair one, is that I wanted more Lady Sif. I'm sorry but you have one of the most beautiful women in the world, who happens to be a fantastic actress, playing one of the most badass and intriguing roles in the movie and she's barely even relevant? You've gotta do better than that. Supposedly she originally had a more prominent role even creating somewhat of a love triangle but the studio ultimately decided to trim that back, essentially eliminating a large chunk of her screen time. After some thought I decided it didn't really ""hurt"" the film so I won't let it affect the rating but I would've liked liked to see her more. Hopefully we'll get that in the special features when it releases on blu-ray. Overall, I'd say this is probably the third best Avengers film yet, behind Iron Man and The Avengers. Hopefully they continue to deliver because they've got one helluva series going.",11 November 2013," Simply amazing!

199,Anurag-Shetty,"Thor: The Dark World continues with the story of the God of Thunder, Thor(Chris Hemsworth). After Loki(Tom Hiddleston), is imprisoned for his despicable crimes in New York(these events take place in The Avengers) by Odin(Anthony Hopkins), Thor along with Sif(Jaimie Alexander), Fandral(Zachary Levi), Volstagg(Ray Stevenson) & Hogun(Tadanobu Asano) set about the task of bringing peace & harmony to the nine realms.

It was even better than Superman reboot, Man of Steel because even though it was action packed, there were humorous scenes as well. The 3D was effective except, in the scenes with dialogs. The special effects were out of this world. I loved the fact that there was more Asgard, this time. I also liked that they introduced us to more worlds like, Anaheim & Svartalfheim. The climax was so unexpected & mind blowing. This is the only Marvel film, to have such an unforeseen twist. This film was way better than Thor(2011). It was way more action packed & hilarious compared to Kenneth Branagh's watered down original. The performances was definitely one, of the many pros of the film. Chris Hemsworth plays the part of Thor, to perfection. Natalie Portman is brilliant as Jane Foster. However the standout performer in the film is, yet again, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston's cheeky & witty dialog delivery keeps the viewers guffawing for a good part of the film. However, Loki can turn terrifying in an instant. This shows what a versatile actor Tom Hiddleston is. No matter how despicable Loki is, I can pretty much guarantee that everyone loves Loki. This is the magic of Hiddleston. Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin. Christopher Eccleston is menacingly evil as Malekith.

200,rambofan4life,"Really action packed improvement over Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), ""The Winter Soldier"" is my second favorite MCU superhero film. I love this film to death more than the first one. Chris Evens and Scarlett Johansson gives a wonderful performance as Steve Rogers - Captain America and Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow. The Russo brothers knew how to direct a much action packed better sequel than ""The First Avenger"" because this is no origin story it is an action packed adrenaline superhero the best action sequel in the MCU universe. I love this movie to death I love, love it so much. Directed was by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo brothers who directed this sequel, much better than any other sequel is.Steve Rogers - Captain America is living quietly in Washington D.C. and trying to adjust to the modern world. When a S.H.I.E.L.D. colleague Nick Fury
(Samuel L. Jackson) comes under attack. Steve becomes embroiled in a web of intrigue that threatens to put the world at risk. Joining forces with the ""Black Widow"". Captain America struggles to expose the ever-widening conspiracy while fighting off professional assassin sent to silence him at every turn. When the full scope of the villainous plot is revealed. Captain America and Black Widow enlist the help of a new ally, the ""Falcon"". However, they soon find themselves up against an unexpected and formidable enemy - the ""Winter Soldier""The smash box office hit is the best sequel that is also a thriller in which a viewer ask him self who killed Nick Fury and why. We found an answers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromise and is taken over by Hydra from the first movie and many powerful men's are involved. This movie is better than decent or solid it is the best sci-fi action film ever made in my opinion. It is better paced than ""The First Avenger"" filled with more action and adventure excitement. I love the bound between Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff I did not except that coming. Chris Evens completely acts different and much better than he did in Infinity War I enjoy his performance more than I did in the first movie.One of the best fighting scenes ever, in my opinion. I love the choreography of it. Best hand to hand combat from Chris Evens as Captain America. The fight scenes were completely badass, not only do I love Winter Soldiers design, but this whole fight was fantastic. Who ever did the fight choreography needs to get a raise. I love the music score for Winter Soldier by Henry Jackman excellent soundtrack. Seriously there is so many gun fire in this movie so many guns, explosion, explosive weapons they are used well. The highway fight sequence is a bad-ass, kick-ass scene ever in the movie, I love this scene so much. Cap is in slacks, doing backwards cartwheels, straight up throwing guys like it's no issue. The Winter Soldier has Cap's shield, is throwing tricks with that knife all ambidextrous. Al this in 3 minutes. It's so awesome, and so well done.Captain America trilogy is the best superhero trilogy ever, it is my favorite trilogy ever and I love all three movies to death. MILES way better than Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy! and god that Winter Soldier theme! Yes I am a huge fan of this film and so I am fan of the first and third film.Great performance from Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes - Winter Soldier he was a bad-ass assassin I ever saw. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon good performance from the actor Anthony Mackie which he showed up in Ant-Man. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce the main villain in this movie was excellent and bad-ass bad guy best performance I ever saw. Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow I have no words for the guy except ""Excellent"" - I enjoy him in every movie he ever was. Brock Rumlow is a great bad guy and villain. Samuel L. Jackson did a wonderful job as Nick Fury, finally his character did something to do in this film, like fighting with assassins and so on. ©Captain America jumps out of a plane with no parachute bad-ass, the movie has nothing but action sequences in any MARVEL movies so we can say ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is the best of the Captain America trilogy mine second personal favorite action MCU universe film.",27 September 2018," ""The Winter Soldier"" - the best action-packed bad ass kick-ass comic book movie

201,fear_da_fro_bro,"This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well...What I love about the character is that Steve Rogers has ""I'm-a-man-out- of-time issues"" but he's comfortable with the chaos that it brings. In acclimating himself to this century he is at his best. Yes, most people would be overwhelmed but because of who he is and where he's from, he's able to cope and adapt. The serum that gives him his physical edge also gives him a mental boost. It's his emotions that are raw and unaided. Time has passed since Avengers so we don't get to see his day to day amazement and adjustment. I'm glad they skipped that stuff. What we do see is the man who once represented America and has become alien to America and it's slanted values. The passage of time. Add those struggles to a full blown conspiracy film and what results might just be the best film released all year long.Steve Rogers is basically a John Wayne American. The world shifts to him and it's his job to tell everybody ""Here's they way things should be done."" We saw that in Avengers and even the first film after he gathered his Howling Commandos. Now, the powers that be are a lot more flexible in terms of loyalties and how they're going to get certain jobs done. How he handles this century's gray morality is at the heart of the film.Like most men from the 1940's, Steve keeps things to himself and keeps his emotions bottled up. (EX: the first film when he mentions his mother dying of TB and he was even embarrassed when Peggy found him mourning alone for Bucky) So, bringing The Black Widow in to this film gives him someone who is going to draw out his story, because he's never going to offer it up of his own accord. Natasha learns from him. Fury learns from him. Sam Wilson learns from him. Yet, they all give him something in return. Every character used is utilized perfectly and smartly. Falcon for example, is not in awe of the legend of Captain America. This is exactly what Steve wants in a friend and in a fellow soldier, to not have to be Captain America. Everyone fits perfectly in to the plot and allows access to different beats, tones and emotional depth. Yes, conspiracy thrillers need depth and this one has it.Captain America is probably the only superhero left in this world of the reboot who is singularly heroic. He doesn't have this dark existential quandary like other reinventions. Plugging that resolute goodness into a morally complex story means he doesn't question what he believes, but he questions whether anybody else does anymore. He doesn't question his foundation but he questions where he has ended up and what his role must now be. The conspiracy element and structure of this story helps in that Captain America is not up on a pedestal being self righteous, he's in a corner and that makes you want to root for the guy. He believes in what he's doing and the viewer is along for a great ride sharing that belief.Marvel movies usually establish character early. This one starts out fast but it's got a lot of character in it. The first act packs a punch but does it laying the groundwork for a remarkable third act. They take time showing the issues and you immediately empathize with Steve. Giving us good character depth means the action delivers more punch. And the action here is beyond great. This movie absolutely punches you in the face in the best way possible. The action has advanced a lot from the first film. How he now operates in the world and kicks butt is all very impressive.So, this is probably Marvel's grittiest movie and it's also their best sequel to date. There's a dash of humor but there's mostly a wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film.",21 March 2014," A wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film

202,Sahl_95,"Went into the movie not expecting much as I felt that the first Captain America was one of the weaker movies in Phase one of the Avengers. However, this movie was one of the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.First off, the action and fight scenes in the movie are just awesome and there is plenty of action to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. There is also enough humour to balance all this. The characters all had their own amazing moments and the acting is decent as well. You get to see more of Nick Fury, and he was awesome in this. Black Widow is used much more in this movie and as well as being badass, she brings out more of the Captain's story. Sam Wilson (the Falcon) is great and is involved in some great action scenes. The villains in this movie were awesome as well.Quite enjoyed the story as well. There were a few twists; some unexpected, some expected. And the reveal of the unexpected twists in the final third were epic. The story is not just about Captain America and the Winter Soldier, there are darker forces at play and causes the Captain to ask dangerous questions.This movie is very entertaining, the story is decent, the ending is awesome and satisfying and I would recommend watching this. Makes for a decent political thriller as well. This will easily be one of my favourite movies.",25 March 2014," Pure Awesomeness

203,doomas10,"Now ""The winter soldier"" is everything a Captain America movie should be. While it maintains some of the humour that now has become the trademark of Marvel films, TWS is way more serious than all of them combined. And this is truly where the film feels so brave and yes different than any other superhero flicks that we have seen. Which brings me to the most important point, the plot. While of course it is not going to be the most original or complicated film of the century, there is the basic screen writing elements that so much lack from modern day blockbusters. You have the (likable) characters and a mystery they need to solve along with a racing clock. It reminded me the 70's political paranoia thrillers (3 days of the Condor - another Redford link, The parallax view, Z) and it is a welcome tone that makes the WS to differentiate itself from the rest. There are strong scenes regarding political fear, control, and information manipulation but it never feels bloated or overbearing. the purpose is to entertain even if it manages to squeeze through a bit of political views with Rogers replacing the viewer's voice on screen. At one point there is a talk about who is who which results in every man for himself mayhem in one of the most interesting sequences that you may see this year. We do not get this stuff these days!Besides the charged plot, the introduction of new characters and the mega mayhem in the streets of Washingthon DC, the Russos have found time (and they should bloody do since TWS is 2 and a half hours long!) to inject some sentiments in the proceedings - a visit to Peggy, a confrontation with Fury regarding SHIELDs actions, Bucky's memory recall, Natasha's kissing talk. They could have easily skip these ""crap"" but instead the extra running time feels adjusted and coherent with a bit of more characterization which results to bring us closer to the on screen counterparts. However, the action is what took me by surprise. The bar has been set higher now. It is truly unbelievable to think that these two directors (of the ""Community"" fame) came with such inventive ways of using Cap's shield. Finally, the shield gets to be seen in all of its glory. In addition, all the fist fights (and they are many) are excellent examples and putting the glasses to the school of frantic edit (which I truly despise) with varied and rapid choreography. A terrific elevator fight sequence probably stands out as truly memorable whereas the encounters with the Winter Soldier never feel repetitive. The Russo brothers keep changing the game from stealth and cloak missions, to car chases, to gun fires, to dog fights, to fist fights. There is something for everyone here and it is arguably among the finest I have seen. Impressive considering their credits. Real stunt work (backflips, wrestle moves, somersaults, etc), real fights and it is a pleasing sight to go away from superhero duels of the Avengers, Thor and Iron man. These characters rely on instincts and bullets. No more and no less and most of them do have some brutal moments for a PG-13 film (and blood too).The actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles. While Evans came out as a bit arrogant in the ""Avengers"" and the least interesting character, here he truly shines. First time ever, I actually bought what he was bringing on the table. This is a soldier who believed in protecting the people and their freedom. Here though, in the modern era of espionage with multiple intrigues and political events, he finds himself unable to identify which side he is on and for what. At one point he even considers himself Fury's caretaker of terrorist ""problems"". The other side of the coin is Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury and Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. It is nice to see Jackson expanding his role from 1 minute cameo in ""Iron Man"" to a fully supporting actor here. But the real standout is Robert Redford. Kevin Feige (the producer) probably knows how to do casting because so far there has not been a single acting mistake. Bringing heavy-acting-weight Redford to a superhero film is actually a bold move and while most movies do not focus on the talented cast, here the Russo brothers give Redford plenty of close ups and necessary gravitational dialogue that kept surprised me for a ""summer"" and ""mindless"" blockbuster. Antony Mackie plays Falcon believably enough and it is very good to see a great supporting turn instead of being the comedic sidekick. The winter soldier now himself is as you would have expected? probably the best villain outside Loki(!) in the marvel films. A truly unstoppable and cool killing machine that shows no remorse or regret considering his complete disregard (and destructive) actions throughout the film. Shaw manages to bring a bit of menace to a generally light hearted series of fantasy films as he has to act more with his eyes rather than sharing any scenes of actual dialogue. Is it perfect? Of course not but it does not feel that it is drugging forever or raising any boring flags. There is plenty of plot, intelligence and sweet characters moments to keep anyone satisfying. This is blockbuster at its finest, a superhero film with heart, immersive action and subtle touches of humour. Totally recommended.",27 March 2014," Brilliant film!

204,bobochildrunningwild,"I'd have to rate Captain America The Winter Soldier as one of the best comic book movies ever made. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get.

Spider- Man has generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character. Iron Man has generally held the most grounded and well liked superhero film. The Avengers has generally held the title as most highly rated and best film the genre has seen. Well, Captain America TWS can compete with them all in every category.

205,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"When Fury(L. Jackson, tough as usual, for him and these) is attacked by an unknown enemy, the Captain(Evans, will of steel, heart of gold) and Black Widow(Johansson, sultry and devious – this uses her right, finally) find themselves(they have a great chemistry, with a charming running gag of her wanting to pair him up with a girl, going through a list of ones they both know; and with his straightforward nature, and her relative lack of integrity, they both affect the other towards them, benefiting both) with no one else to trust, except perhaps the veteran Falcon(Mackie, amiable), as they uncover a genuinely devastating truth, while on the run from a considerable force – including the elusive assassin, The Winter Soldier(Stan, terrifying, pure awesome pretty much every second he's on screen).This is just short of the level of The Avengers. It uses the strong continuity of the cinematic Marvel(as in, their own studio) universe better than any of the others, and does justice to many different elements, most of them set up prior to this. Events occur in this that will have serious consequences for future entries. The plot-driven nature and approach of a 70's political thriller(where some characters, all credible and with something to do, happen to wear a flag or the like) in a contemporary setting and with biting satire(on foreign policy, something not entirely new to these, but never before this sharp commenting on mass surveillance and executions taking place before any trial against the (supposed) perpetrator) is spot-on. From a 40's war flick, with heroism and defined lines between good and evil, to the modern method of taking on the opposition – with spying, and questionable tactics(compared to one army versus another).The action all comes about naturally, it's personal, hard-hitting and, on account of next to no CGI, it's ""real"". Each intense set-piece is varied(fighting, shooting, chasing both on foot and vehicular), you will remember them, and except for one bit, they feel fresh and original. Among the very few weaknesses are that Sharon(VanCamp, another compelling and strong woman) has nothing to do in this, appearing as if her important scenes were cut, and/or that she was setup for the next one. She is the only one that that goes for, a pleasant surprise considering the seemingly bloated cast of characters. This explores S.H.I.E.L.D., and how the iconic super soldier fits into it or, whether or not he does, at all.

207,vicvonfate,"This film finds Captain America still adjusting to the modern day, while working under the increasingly morally ambiguous government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The set up is masterfully done. This is the third time we've seen the character and it's by far the most complex. The Avengers film touched bit with his feelings of what it was like to be in the modern era, but besides the deleted scenes, they had no time to dive in to the subject matter in that movie. That's not the case here. This is a wonderful character study to go along with a purely thrilling plot. This was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver the film the character deserves at this time. What makes Steve/cap interesting isn't his abilities but the man himself. The ""man out of time"" to be exact. He must come to terms with a past that is long gone and a longing for a better more decent era. Dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of an organization like S.H.I.E.L.D. is taking its toll on a member of ""the greatest generation."" As he's finding his way, his past comes back and explodes all throughout his new life.Enter The Winter Soldier, who is an amoral assassin and an agent of shady government rogues. Saying any more about what is an ultimately cool character would be a spoiler. Fans of the books know who he is and what he's about but movie fans need to find their own way. I really enjoyed the origin and First Avenger but this movie is darker than the original film. It has a whole new flavor and that;s exactly what was needed. The 1940's romance and even the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" tone fit the first film quite nicely but would have been out of place in this story. Just like Cap, adaptation is a key. Steve is still an unquestioning patriot but he shifts from being an unquestioning soldier. This is where his old-fashioned values pay off. Questioning what is wrong and questioning what is morally cloudy is a test of true character. That is exactly why the character of Steve Rogers is so interesting. He's so much more than a super soldier boy scout. There's depth, angst and pathos to the max. He is out-of-place and he is old- fashioned but proud of that in a way. He also is an enhanced thinker so it's not like modern era gadgets confound him. It's all played just right. The story itself is a good old fashion action thriller with a ton of intrigue.

We see Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, and he is starting to get used to this world, the 21st century. He is a charming and a bit quirky guy. Especially the relationship between him and Natasha Romanoff, aka the Black Widow, is absolutely amazing! She is a strong female character and that is so great to see in a superhero movie. The movie soon turns into a conspiracy spy movie esque setting, we see old characters returning. Basically: S**t just goes down. At some point there was a bit too much action in my opinion.

214,friendly_poison,"On a personal note, after Batman Begins, after The Avengers and after the evolution of the comic book movie from a cult audience pleaser to an award winning blockbuster, I thought to myself. Well where could it go from here.The answer is, here.From the first moment to the last breath, this film totally blew me away on a level I couldn't predict. With Iron Man and The Avengers itself getting most of the critical praise and fan support it was clear to me that Chris Evan's, Steve Rogers was in need of a boost, many fans also argued that ol' Cap got the least amount of treatment out of the Avengers. If this is so then I chock it up to him being the proverbial 'fish out of water' for that film.From that last statement I can go on to say that the 'fish out of water' thing is a central thing to this film as Steve Rogers fights to face his new place in the world, having been thrust from WWII into present day in the span of a heartbeat. And Chris Evans handles this pressure with excellence, Evans is loaded with a powerhouse performance throughout and aided by a stellar supporting cast including Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson, Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury, Cobie Smulder's Maria Hill, Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce, Frank Grillo's Brock Rumlow and Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier.In stark contrast to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) films we have seen so far, this film can be truly accessible for 'semi' intense comic fans as well as the die hard as the films genre feels more along the lines of an epic action/political thriller than the spandex laden days of old.Trust me, you need to see this film man.

On top of that were the glowing early reviews, some of which saying that ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is even better than ""The Avengers.""

However, not only does this film manage to surpass the excellent first installment, but in some ways surpass ""The Avengers.""Taking place after the events of 2012's ""The Avengers,"" Captain Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans reprising his role) struggles to adapt to a world shrouded in fear and obsessed with security. Now working for the government organization S.H.I.E.L.D, Rogers faces the conflict of being ill-informed of his recruiters' ulterior motives and hidden agendas. The retro, simplistic era of the 1940s is far behind him, and Rogers must use his skills and wits to take down a possible conspiracy inside of S.H.I.E.L.D. Coming along for the ride are Black Widow (played reliably well by Scarlett Johansson) and newcomer The Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie of ""Pain and Gain""). Together they must take down a force none of them expected to face.Unlike previous Marvel films like ""The Avengers,"" and ""Thor,"" the plot of this movie is much more down-to-Earth. In today's world of NSA controversy and outright paranoia, many plot elements in this film give it a very modern and relevant feel. In many ways, this is a stark contrast to the retro, swashbuckling feel that the first ""Captain America"" gave off. This is a perfect way to tell the Captain's story; Steve Rogers has been thrust into the modern day against his will, and after the fantastical events of ""The Avengers,"" he is just now starting to be affected by today's mentality of security. It's indeed very interesting plot foundation for a superhero film.As well as being a fine continuation of the first film's story, the new elements that this film brings to the ""Captain America"" series are quite good enough for the film to stand on its own. Even those who didn't care for the first movie could get a kick out of them. Among the new characters is The Hawk, an ex-military superhero introduced in this film. This character is immensely likable, partly because of Anthony Mackie's fine performance, but mostly because they introduce him from the very beginning and flesh out his character.Also joining the cast is veteran actor Robert Redford as the sinister Alexander Pierce. Redford is the type of villain that is rather refreshing to see in a superhero film: villains unaided by superpowers or violence and who carry the story with wits and malice alone. He doesn't need a mech-suit or psychic abilities, but he is a fine menace for the First Avenger to go up against.In addition to the fine new characters, every action set piece in this movie is both exhilarating and an absolute thrill to watch. What makes them even better is that they are accompanies by a gripping story with plenty of shocking and even emotional twists and turns. Even after seeing aliens invade New York in ""The Avengers,"" this movie's more grounded approach to storytelling gives a sense that the stakes are higher than ever in the Marvel Universe. Fear not though, this movie is far from a dark one, and there is plenty of that good ole' Marvel humor to give some levity. I'm pretty sure that audiences won't be prepared for how intense the story alone is.It's not very common that audiences get an April movie that's not only great, but exceptional. ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" is indeed a masterpiece, and as much of a bold statement as it seems, it is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. The amount of sheer quality it possesses makes it an absolute must-see.",4 April 2014," One of The Best

218,alucard_castlevania86,"This movie exceeded my expectations in a lot of ways. The plot was very interesting. I never would have guessed that the story turned out the way it did and thought that it was nothing more than just a Captain America v.s Winter Soldier battle. It definitely will make you question yourself about certain things in life such as friendship, loyalty and patriotism. The actors all were well cast too and got more screen time in this movie than they had in the Avengers which is a good thing. Chris Evans cements his his as title lead character Steve Rogers. He displays his tough brute strength and integrity here perfectly. Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow was great here in her own way but I just couldn't see her and Cap as a couple here. Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury was the surprise one here for me since I never expected him to do some serious action in the film. Anthony Mackie's Falcon and Cobie Smulder's Maria Hills was a little letdown for me here (again) since I expected them have a bigger impact role in the film but they still managed to do their parts perfectly.Its been a while since I've seen Robert Redford on screen and his Alexander Pierce's character was also great to watch. A surprising entry for me would have to Emily Van Camp's Sharon Carter/Agent 13 character. I never expected her to have an impact to the film and she never really looked like it at first either. However, I really would have preferred her and Rogers to have more screen time together instead but she still did a solid job but the biggest performance for me would have to be Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier. The guy was an absolute terrifying and menacing opponent for Captain Rogers and really gave him a hard time. The shield was like nothing to him and if the fight between him and Rogers went on a little longer, I have a feeling that Rogers would definitely lose the fight Most of the their fight's choreography were neatly well done. Kudos to that and the part where he grabbed the shield with one hand after Cap threw it at him was personally one of my favorite moments in the movie. The sub-plot between them was really good and and heart warming to watch. I was relief by how it ended between them but it did leave me asking what would have it been like if things had ended differentlyThe combination of CGI and special effects techniques were verygood and the amount of action was just awesome and more entertaining to watch than The Avengers. There are also a lot of great lines in the film that and moments in the film and the friendship moments between Cap and Winter Soldier in was very heartwarming but also made me sad. You somehow want to feel sorry for Bucky since he doesn't know why he does the things that he does because its all about orders. This movie also had some of the best lines and some enjoyable but not too over the top humor in it. The OST was really patriotic, memorable and darkish to listen too but I liked it verymuchAll in all, congrats Marvel. This movie deserves my perfect score rating. It slightly surpasses The Avengers but definitely way better than Iron Man 3 for me. Can't wait for Captain America 3. Lets hope they will bring in Baron Zemo next",27 March 2014," Better Than The Avengers

219,bhgyfr,"I would like to start off this review by quickly speaking about a 2012, masterpiece film, Marvel's Avengers Assemble. It was HUGE! There isn't any film that I can think of that would be as big as it, excluding it's next two sequels. But Captain America: The Winter Soldier, although not being as big as the Avengers, in all honesty was better. Sure, you can ultimately disagree. Feel free to and do all you can to try and persuade me into changing my mind, and eventually saying ""Wait! Yeah, I was wrong, Avengers is still better, and I was stupid to think otherwise..."" - ain't happening. Captain America: The Winter Soldier, although not being as hyped up for, and as big as the Avengers, in my opinion, was slightly better, if not quite a far bit better. It's by far my favourite Marvel film so far (alongside X-Men: First Class). Let me tell you this- genuinely, it's more interesting to watch, has better action-scenes, has better dialogue all-round, has better weaponry, has better characters (and they're developed quite beautifully may I add), and above all else, has better directing. Chris Evans returning in his recurring role as Captain. Steven Grant Rogers, the ultimate super-soldier who is upfront against James ""Bucky"" Barnes (a former friend of his who becomes a super-assassin and hardly even recognises or acknowledges Steve for who he is). The film is literally full of action-packed, thrilling scenes, intense scenes, incredible visual effects, superb and interesting dialogue and much more. Seriously, this is the Captain America film, and more importantly, Marvel film you've all been waiting for. It really, really is.

221,bluesman-20,Captain America:The Winter Soldier starts the new marvel era off with a lot of action. Winter Soldier takes the classic Nick Fury VS S.H.I.E.L.D story from the 80's and gives it a good sharp twist and makes it a Captain America Story. But one that travels the Marvel universe. S.H.I.E.L.D has been infiltrated by HYDRA. the entire organization has been taken over and on the eve of SHIELD'S biggest plan for world security . they plan to launch three helicarrier drones. Each Drone has the firepower to decimate a country. When a tense conversation with Captain America leaves Nick Fury thinking he tries to go into his files to find out more. Only to find out someone has blocked all access. Fury is targeted for termination. When he very narrowly escapes an attempt on his life he goes to the apartment of Steve Rogers. And asks for Captain America'a help. Fury is attacked in cap's apartment by a shadowy assassin called the Winter Soldier. He's as fast as Captain America and as strong with one cybernetic arm. And the Soldier is totally ruthless. As Fury lies dying in Cap's apartment he gives him a flash drive containing all of SHIELD'S secrets and tells him to trust no one. Cap takes Fury to the Hospital and contacts the Black Widow who was close to Fury. As the two heroes watch over Fury. Cap is ordered to SHIELD just as Fury dies. Steve hides the flash drive and goes over to see SHIELD'S Director Alexander Pierce. It is here Steve learns of how far Hydra's reach is. Steve is questioned by Pierce. When Pierce isn't satisfied with the answers to His questions he orders Steve Rogers killed.. Steve fights his way out of SHIELD. With only the Widow for help Steve must find out the answer to what Hydra is up to And to stop it. He also must confront the Winter Soldier again. Steve and the Widow recruit Sam Wilson a highly skilled former soldier code named the Falcon for good reasons. As Cap gets closer to the truth. And as he assembles his allies to take out SHIELD. He finds out the sinister truth about Who the Winter Soldier is.CAPTAIN America : THE WINTER SOLDIER . is a fine action story that puts super heroes into a world best occupied by James Bond. and makes it work. Stay for the after credit scenes. And you'll find out just how far the ripples of this film go. A high degree of writing and skillful direction moves this film above the rest of the marvel films. Add in some fine acting and you got a great popcorn film. the Only Drawback to me was Robert Redford. While Redford is great as Pierce. It seems as if they ran out of things for him to do in this film. which is a shame. Redford adds a lot of class to this production. And he underacts to his credit which gives his scenes with Samuel L. Jackson's Fury a bigger and better dimension. After All His Pierce isn't a screaming Villain from the old cliffhangers who rub their hands and cackle in evil delight. He's a man of this age and this century who knows how to do things skillfully and hide them in plain view. All in All Winter Soldier is the best Marvel film released thus far. And that's saying something.,21 April 2014," Captain America VS S.H.I.E.L.D.

222,Alise_shenle,"When I first saw the first Captain America movie on DVD, I thought it was OK, slightly boring with the over-the-top Hugo Weaving as Hydra and the mad scientist. Only the last scene had me in tears. So when I said I wanted to watch this movie, many of my friends said it was quite boring, comparing it to Man of Steel. But I was glad that I watched it, because I think it's comparable to Avengers! First of all, the acting. All the good guys can act, Samuel L Jackson (How can he even emote with 1 eye? Marvelous), Sam, Chris Evans, Agent Hill etc. I liked how that the women were given more prominent roles, with Black Widow being the brains of the operation. Although she did have to be romantic with Steve and keep on talking about dates. Luckily, Steve kind of rejected that. He is just the type to love one woman forever! I think that kind of devotion is really the norm back in the 40s, and that is so rare, nowadays movies have a lot of kisses and hugs, more doesn't mean that it is meaningful. Another thing I really like about the movie is how Steve showed us to be true to ourselves. Just because he is a soldier doesn't mean he had to follow orders. It's what we do that matters, not who we are. Lastly, I am so shipping Captain America and Winter Soldier. Well, at the end Steve face a dilemma, whether to kill his friend or be killed. If it were me, I think I'd just save myself. But that is not his style. He just has so much faith in everyone that it just blows me away. He values teamwork and is a really transformational leader. Talking about the movie, it was really funny and the action scenes were great.

Natasha Romanov, aka Black Widow, has become the Captain's de facto partner within SHIELD, and she does her best to help him find a place in the 21st century.However, SHIELD begins taking a path that Captain America is uncomfortable in following. In this, conflict arises, and the Captain must ultimately the find the truth of what's really going on.But the truth is not what he expected.This film is a solid addition to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has all of the elements that made The First Avenger a great film, adapts them and then adds upon them to make a film that's unique and yet fits the Marvel style perfectly.While the run time may seem a tad excessive, it is necessary to cram in all of the action of this film.

225,Loving_Silence,"Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it.

The biggest surprise for me was Dave Bautista who I thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for Drax. Chris Pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional scenes.CGI in this film was super, there's nothing I hate more than too much CGI in a film but it was so good in Guardians that I was completely lost in it. Never have a seen space look so good, the battles were incredible and Groot and Rocket never looked out of place (aside from being a tree and raccoon).Gunn is the perfect director for this, his tone, his balance of comedy, action and emotion blended perfectly and directing GOTG would have been no easy job. DC are still trying hard to get Justice League going, Marvel just made a film with a talking tree and Raccoon and it was AWESOME!!!Not a bad performance all round and comic fans will be happy with certain nods and winks scattered throughout. Probably my top Marvel film yet, it has the fresh new feeling the first Iron Man had with all the action and humour of The Avengers. 10 stars from me, even if your not a comic book or sci-fi fan, this movie has something for everyone.",31 July 2014," A New Hope

227,jakimiku,"Great expectations before the film, definitely, and they really paid off. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best Marvel films to date, and a really good sci-fi at that too. The film is strong on so many levels, outstanding characters, great worlds, is emotional and humorous.Peter Quill, or Star Lord as he likes to call himself, is a quick-witted man of Earth thrown into the far reaches of galaxy, who has stolen an artifact that everyone seems to want. By accident he stumbles upon four other characters, Gamora the assassin, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket the enhanced raccoon and Groot the humanoid tree, and the five of them form an unlikely team. The characters are really well presented, their emotional core is strong and back stories engaging. In short, they're interesting and easy to like. All of them have great moments and keep us wanting for more and more. Rocket, in particular, steals the show with his anger management problems and bright one-liners. It was great to see a group of people each with their own agenda come together, this dynamic worked really well. Star-Lord carried a lot of this weight, and was very sympathetic.The film doesn't take itself very seriously, which was refreshing to see after also great yet darker themes of Thor and Captain America 2's. Guardians has a lot of laughs, witty dialogue, characters rub off on each other (and the audience), writing is perfect. The film is so entertaining, non-stop adventure but also knows when to balance with more dramatic themes. Scenery and worlds are spectacular, visual effects top notch. As a reader of the Guardians comics it was great to see some smaller motifs thrown in that may not be necessarily caught by regular viewers, but which the comic book readers will definitely be thankful for too.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy was an awesome watch. Amazing characters, vivid cinematography, great dialogue, lots of humor, soundtrack was nice, story exciting.

228,zentertainmentweeklydotcom,"(Rating: 12A, 121 mins) Written by Zen Terrelonge Starring – Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista, Vin DieselIf you've seen the trailers for Guardians of the Galaxy, you'd be within your rights to think Marvel Studio execs have been hitting the bottle hard or taking LSD.The film revolves around a group of dysfunctional but goodhearted criminals – think Robin Hood's Merry Men of the future – comprising human thief Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Pratt), green assassin Gamora (Saldana), talking raccoon Rocket (Cooper), knife-wielding Drax the Destroyer (Bautista), and walking tree Groot (Diesel).Like the Avengers, the Guardians get off to a false start but soon unite over a common cause, namely, the galaxy being obliterated by genocidal maniac, Ronan – not Keating – the Accuser.Ah yes, the old, let's-exterminate-everyone-for-the-mistakes-of-their-forefathers ploy.But unlike Avengers Assemble, Guardians of the Galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly, it's the most unique and delightful film Marvel has created to date.It's a hell of an achievement given the extensive movie library the company is building up and when you consider the characters aren't household names like 'big three' Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, but Marvel seems well aware of that fact with the final production risky to say the least.The film opens in 1988, which is when Quill is abducted from Earth, and 26 years later we see he's become a crooked intergalactic outlaw with a taste for all things shiny, valuable and not his.Given the distinct decade in which he was taken, his cassette player and mixtape of 70s and 80s tracks are laced throughout the film, which creates a quirky yet grounded quality in the midst of all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way.In addition to the soundtrack, jokes and comedy have never been more of a feature in a Marvel film – perhaps Iron Man 3 was the closest – as gags are thrown into the unlikeliest of scenarios to lessen the tension, and I would imagine, to really differentiate itself from Avengers Assemble, Star Wars and Star Trek, which by comparison are left looking very sombre.That said, if you were going to compare Pratt's Quill to someone, the character is quite reminiscent of Chris Pine's Captain James Kirk – smart, womanising, reckless leaders, who eventually find their feet.The editing is supreme and makes each bit of dialogue super-sharp and tight, so when the infamous five are bickering or talking generally, the repartee all feels really clean and natural without being awkward or forced.Thor can be stubborn, Iron Man can be arrogant and Captain America is considered too stiff, but all of the Guardians bring even more wildly different qualities to the table and offer some diversity that doesn't ever grate or bore, which wouldn't have been possible without such excellent casting.Meanwhile, the film is very much in the here and now, with Quill's backstory the only one that truly gets a look-in, which creates a sense of intrigue about his colleagues who only have their pasts hinted at, meaning sequel fodder.There's just no way of knowing where you're going and tonally the movie delivers a piece of everything and it's done big and without hesitation.Guardians may have been a gamble, but I'm Grooting for it to Rocket to the top.10/10",24 July 2014," The most unique and delightful film Marvel has created to date

229,Old_Man_From_Scene_24,"I know, I know. This will incontrovertibly attract a lot of hate from die-hard Dark Knight fans, but guess what? I'm one of those who thinks Nolan is the epitome of how to make a perfect superhero spectacle. Or at least, I was until tonight. This film will blow your mind. Quite literally, it is jam-packed with edge-of-your-seat action thrills and pure comedic gold. Don't be expecting a moody companion piece like that of Nolan's trilogy, or Man of Steel. It keeps more in touch with Avengers, although it's a lot funnier and really builds upon the upcoming Infinity Gauntlet arc. The actors are incredible, matching the character developments, the dialogue and action sequences are spectacular and the visual effects should surely earn a nod come Oscar time, as I'd personally put them on par with those seen in the recent Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The run length compliments the well-scripted pacing of the movie itself, whilst plenty of interesting secondary characters litter Guardians with an ensemble cast that has exceeded anything yet seen in the Marvel/DC movie worlds. I don't pertain to the DC versus Marvel argument, but this masterpiece alone has certainly put Marvel on the front foot in terms of cinema outings, far surpassing the very enjoyable Man of Steel and, I believe, edging out Nolan's trilogy and then some. I thoroughly recommend this for any with a borderline sci-fi/superhero love, and advise you to remain for the tantalising post-credits scene, although many of the non-comic fans might not get the references.

Guardians has a good humor vibe throughout the movie with a compelling plot and an ultimately brilliant outcome of a movie. I may even see it again! I have read the comics before the movie was thought of and let me tell you, it was very true to the characters, and let me say, I had doubts about Vin Diesel's talent between Groot's small role in speech, but now I don't think anybody else could have matched how well he performed. Marvel can surely be at the top of greatness at the moment with it's movies, however I highly doubt that and I cannot wait for the next installment of superhero action brought to us by Marvel.

231,achyutaghosh,"Guardians of the Galaxy- Simply MarvellousYes it is a movie of cosmic proportions, an inter-planetary fantasy of epic scale. Yes it has a team of underdogs taking down a Goliath. Yes it has a talking raccoon and a tree as main characters. But what makes Guardians of the Galaxy the best Marvel movie of all times is the fact that it is the closest embodiment of the Marvel comic book ethos- full of wit and charm, spunk and fun, and of course, action.Sample this- somewhere in the universe, in a desolate planet with incessant water fountains, where a once proud culture reigned. A masked man lands in a spaceship, and charts out a path through the devastated surroundings. At one point, he puts on a Walkman, switches on Redbone's ""Come and Get Your Love"" and breaks into an impromptu jig. He is in some mood. On his way he encounters small dinosaur like creatures that he either footballs them or treats them as microphones, karoakaying his way and leaping across mortal dangers to steal an Infinity gem, as the credits start to roll. Marvel fans would be aware that the stone is one of the most powerful objects in the universe. This effortless boogey sets the tone for the movie- an irreverent take on universe shattering events.Unlike the Avengers, since the characters are all new, but even more bizarre, they do need a round of formal introductions-""Star-Lord, man, legendary outlaw. Forget it"" - Peter QuillPlayed in zany style by Chris Pratt, Peter Quill was kidnapped from earth when he was a child by a gang of bounty hunters. Today he is a galaxy trotting thief and space scavenger who likes to call himself Star-Lord. Tremendously attached to his mother's music, Quill is a Romeo who has survived in this cutthroat profession so far solely because of his improvising skills.""I am a warrior, an assassin. I don't dance"" - GomoraActed by Zoe Saldana (this time in a shade of green), Gomora is an adopted daughter of Thanos, surgically enhanced into a killing weapon. Gomora is exactly what she says, but learn to dance, she does, courtesy Star-Lord.""Nothing goes over my head! My reflexes are too fast, i would catch it""- Drax, the DestroyerPlayed by WWE star Dave Bautista, Drax is a naive to the point of stupidity, suicidal, tattooed mountain of a brute with a love for knifes matched only by his thirst for violence. He specifically seeks revenge on Thanos and Ronan, who he holds responsible for the death of his family. ""Ain't no thing like me, except me""- Rocket RaccoonCouldn't be more true. Rocket is like no other thing. Motion captured and voiced in scene stealing style by Bradley Cooper, Rocket is a genetically altered, cybernetic-ally enhanced raccoon with a thing for sarcasm. Happiest when with a big gun and Groot by his side, he is also a master tactician and the technical whiz kid in the team.""I am Groot"" - GrootPerhaps the most emotive role ever essayed by Vin Diesel- Groot is an ever growing humanoid plant whose vocabulary is limited to three words. Serves as the muscle for Raccoon with whom he has kind of a telepathic connection.Also in the mix are even zanier characters- Xondu (Michael Rooker), the bounty hunter that trained Quill and was later double crossed by him, carries an arrow that would have changed the course of the Mahabharata battle, the super-villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) who we will see more of in future Marvel productions, Lee Pace as the fearsome, maniacal Ronan the Accuser- a Kree warlord with blind hatred for Xandarians, and Benicio Del Toro as The Collector- an ancient alien. ""We are all standing, a bunch of idiots standing in a circle"" The Guardians are an anonymous, friendless lot. They have all been scorned and have suffered loss. Till they come together as a team to defend the planet of Xandar and its 12 billion people against Ronan, they have never known a family. The movie is a VFX extravaganza with superlatively detailed action sequences, but at the same time director James Gunn draws effectively from established scifi franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars to create an emotional and expressive tale, while at the same time endowing it with oodles of self deprecating humor. The script is a belly full of laughs, the soundtrack is as it claims- awesome, and the acting by all, though caricatured, is top class. The end product is a an amazingly imaginative, visually stunning, frothy, lively, light hearted ""save the universe"" romp that wows with its dazzling visual style and at the same time keeps tickling your funny bone.

232,billygoat1071,"Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the least known comic books of Marvel. The only reason why the whole world, aside of the fans of the source material, are going to see this because it's a Marvel production, but we should all admit that apart from the comic geek world, nobody knew who Rocket Racoon and Groot were before the film was announced, nobody heard of Starlord before Chris Pratt was attached to the project, and most people hardly knew what it is actually about. While many are still seeking for a Doctor Strange or an Ant-Man movie, we should first get to know something that haven't got enough attention before. And wondrously, these filmmakers introduce this mythology with huge love not only to its own, but also to the fantasy/adventure genre and its old classic form, which easily delivers the sheer fun. But even in the realm of explosions and zany worlds, the best parts of the journey ended up being the scenes with the characters interacting and often to engage a set of great humor and drama. That is already too much to ask for a ridiculously fun blockbuster.It is certainly a space adventure, it already offers a lot of strange alien designs and intergalactic action, but the big stuff aren't the only highlight of the movie. The film would mostly focus on its characters, nearly all of them may be aliens, but their pathos and personalities are down-to-earth. How the team was formed is the same way how The Avengers did. They aren't nice to each other, but they had to get along so they may save the world... or galaxy. But here their motivations are either for revenge or money instead of heroic pride. How they introduced themselves may be a little too over explained through their conversations. The exposition is so relied on the dialogue, but what keeps it from being exhausting is when those talks lead to a naturally clever punchline. The film is just best when the heroes are developing their sudden friendship, turning themselves from cold hearted thugs into a likable band of misfits. The film also has a big love for the seventies music, and it smartly uses it for Peter Quill's last earthly thing he'll ever possess in his otherworldly life.These parts with the characters make the action the secondary appeal of the film, but that doesn't always mean it's a bad thing. This is basically going back to the past blockbusters when rooting for the characters was more important than trying to advance the technical/style abilities. But then, it doesn't have any problem with the action, except sometimes the space battles can be hard to follow but again whenever there's a humor in it, the consistency goes back on track. It's simple fun, sometimes nostalgic piece of adventure that doesn't have to be over-serious to be outright compelling, but it also does have some drama, while it doesn't entirely embraces its sadness, it at least gives some hints behind the characters and manifests the heart and brutality of their backstories eventually. The actors are excellent indeed as they give plenty of shining and charismatic personalities to their awesome characters.The plot may not be too sharp or its villains may not be so memorable, but Guardians of the Galaxy still reaches its goal of lovingly introduces its universe to the ones who've never heard of it. Since everyone is aware that superhero movies are made for the mass more than its fans (let's have to be honest about this), this idea may not always be taken seriously, especially when comic book movies have gone to its dark and gritty era and yet this one offers us stuff like a talking tree and a gunslinging raccoon, but here it is: Guardians of the Galaxy, the movie that isn't meant to exist ending up being one of the greatest films that Marvel ever produced since Iron Man. Is it a bold choice for them? Probably, but it's really not hard having self-awareness. The triumph of the film is reliving the classic, somewhat campy space opera and marking its characters as its real deal, even when they are not as familiar as many of Marvel's heroes. In the end, it's just pure fun, the flaws are there but at some point it doesn't matter. Every moment of the film has the excitement and laugh that anyone would seek for a blockbuster, taking place in a fascinating new world that we are yet to fully explore.",4 August 2014," Marvelous Recognition

233,reelonwheels,"I think it was a surprise to no one that Marvel's next big movie would be a good and profitable film considering the amazing track record of the past 10 superhero movies produced by their studio. Even as the first trailers began to grace movie theaters, fans and casual moviegoers were eager to see this film about a group of characters that even die-hard Marvel fans themselves had little knowledge of. Unlike other characters such as Thor, Capt. America, and Ironman the cosmic superhero team known as the Guardians of the Galaxy have very little notoriety, which presented a huge gamble for Marvel to bring to life. In fact, when one of the first trailers appeared I remember my father turned to me and asked, ""What's with the giant tree man, the raccoon, green lady, and the Han Solo knockoff?"" Nevertheless, Marvel not only adapted this comic series into a great movie but perhaps the best movie in their entire roster and by far the best summer film this year at a time where a great summer blockbuster was desperately needed. It resemble the classic action comedy from the 80s and early 90s with likable characters, great comedic timing, and action sequences that are fun and extremely entertaining in a way that remind me of the Indiana Jones series.Our Cosmic adventure follows Peter Quill (a.k.a. Star-Lord), a thief and outlaw abducted from Earth as a child, who finds and steals a mysterious orb which he intends to sell. Unbeknownst to him this orb is also wanted by a radical madman called Ronan the Accuser, who seeks the powerful artifact hidden within the orb in order to eradicate an entire planet to which he has sworn to destroy. As Peter tries to sell the orb he encounters the cybernetically enhanced assassin Gamora and bounty hunters Rocket and Groot who are all promptly arrested and sent to prison for previous crimes. While in prison they meet Drax the Destroyer, a brutish juggernaut who wants revenge against Ronan and his associates for the death of his family. Together they break out of prison with the intent to sell the orb for a vast amount of money and keep it out of the hands of Ronan and the even more powerful tyrant known as Thanos. From there they uncover the mystery behind the orb's true purpose and prevent Ronan from using its power to kill an entire planet full of innocent people.Unlike other movies which would take a situation like this seriously and with some sense of urgency, the characters in Guardians seem to show little concern or reference to the whole saving the world aspect that you expect to form the basis of every superhero movie. That's not to say that the characters or the writers themselves don't care about what is happening and what is at stake but rather they focus more on the quirky Cheers quality fun-time atmosphere the film creates. This can mostly be demonstrated in Chris Pratt's portrayal as Quill, who has a very laid- back attitude towards everything with a rather mocking cool guy persona which is how a child of the 80s may have believed a cool space superhero would have been like.Speaking of characters, everything single one of them is memorable, interesting, and well portrayed by their actors which by itself is the main selling point of this movie. I have already mentioned Chris Pratt amazing job as the lead, but Zoe Saldana as Gamora is by far one of the best female action heroine in any action movie since Black Widow and has a very commanding presence throughout the entire film. By far one of the biggest surprises is Batista's portrayal of Drax. Never has a wrestler turned actor so much believability and charisma since The Rock delivering both laughs and incredibly entertaining action sequences. However, not one performance can live up to the two characters that completely steal the entire show, Rocket and Groot voice by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Yes, the talking tree and the raccoon are by far the most entertaining and likable characters you'll find in pretty much any movie out there today and you often find yourself begging for another scene featuring them. They are also two of the funniest characters in the entire picture behaving like the classic straight and funny man routine of Abbott and Costello fame but twice as fun. Even though Groot pretty much only says the words ""I am Groot"", which you would figure could get quite annoying and repetitive, becomes funnier every time he says it.Aside from these characters the visual and special effects that are brought to the screen not only allow for some amazing eye candy and interesting creature design that brings the world to life. Everything seemed to have a purpose and meaning for their existence which makes you want to learn more about these environments and the history behind them.Music-wise this is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a film in a long time thanks especially to Star-Lord's awesome mix filled with classic songs from the late 60s to the 70s and some early 80s. Not only are they fun but they fit quite well with the comedic and quirky atmosphere of the movie.Bottom line, if you have not seen this movie you're doing yourself a disservice and if you've reading this review stop now, buy a ticket, and see this movie if you have not already. It's funny, exciting, and you may even find yourself seeing it three or four times if not more just to experience it again.",10 August 2014," Marvel's Space Opera

235,jan_kalina,"Star Wars for today's generation. And maybe even a little better than that because it is just packed with such fun that I haven't experienced in cinema for a long time. Marvel has outdone themselves once again. Marvel and Disney have been worried that this film will be a financial failure but I haven't been in such a crowded theater since the start of the year.This origin story of this band of misfits starts out with an emotional scene, then the tone changes into this Indiana Jones in Space adventure, then it deliberately makes fun of itself and at last all these tones merge into one and the film keeps this tone for the whole length of the film. When it needs to be emotional it is, when it needs an action scene peppered with humor you get and action scene you haven't seen before. Everzthing in this film works except maybe the main villain. He isn't very menacing but you have so much fun in all the other aspects of the film so you are happy to overlook these details. Plus Ronan The Accuser serves just as build-up for a much greater threat.Every character steals every scene they are in. There is no way you will be able to pick your favorite character because in every scene suddenly all of them become your favorite. Chris Pratt has turned over a night into a household name all thanks to Marvel and his charm and likability. Before he served as a professional goof ball but I don't think that will be the case anymore. He shows such a wide range -switching from comedy into action/adventure or a quick-witted scoundrel. Zoe Saldana has established herself a long time as the go-to-action actress and once she shows why she has earned that. She can be sexy, funny and kick ass all in one moment. Dave Bautista is a real surprise here as the warrior taking thins way too literal and therefore his actions and dialogue end up as some of the funniest in the entire film. Bradley Cooper has tried to make his voice unrecognisable as the Rocket Racoon and he has created not another CG animated character but a character from flesh, blood and fur. His cynical, gun-toting maniacal raccoon will surely end up as the fans favorite but as I have stated before all the characters get the same time to shine. Groot, a sentient tree with a limited vocabulary is the most innocent of all of the members of the team.James Gunn had to abandon his dark humor and frankly a little weird for the mainstream audience but what is more than obvious is the enthusiasm that this film was made with. In every shot you can see the filmmaker who finally got the budget to realize all his dreams and ideas and so he stuffs into this film, all those shots and camera angles of his dreams are all here. The film is therefore such an amazing ride which sucks you in for 2 hours and then spits you out and you will want to go and see it immediately. It's that kind of a movie.This is the film that all the teenagers are going to be talking about when they are 30 years old in the same way the Star Wars generation talks about that experience today. The whole Marvel Cinematic Universe is a history in the making which I am sure will be talking about for a long time. The choice is yours if you want to go and see heavy intense drama disguised as a summer blockbuster go see the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes . But if you want a self-referential light-hearted fun go see the Guardians of the Galaxy. It is one of the best films you will be able to see this year.",1 August 2014," ""I'll die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy""

241,jillvesta16,"For the first time in a long time, I have watched a movie and was really entertained. Guardians of the Galaxy beats the One-Comic-Relief, Overdramatic, Rehashed Action Movie format by a long shot. One more movie with the punchy sidekick, only there for the laughs as he accompanies the vanilla Boy Scout main man, and I will Hulk-smash the disc. It's either LOL Larry or Love Interest Lucy in these films. Many Group of Heroes (Avengers) movies fare no better, featuring literally thawed-over, stereotypical characters from older films in name or in spirit about to blast the baddies with the newest tech of the times. Yawn. Thankfully, the Guardians have actual odd and not contrived odd personalities. So does the movie. Oldies music infiltrates the film instead of overdramatic trumpet flourishes, the theme takes place in space instead of downtown Big American City (like Star Trek), and graphics are stellar. Punny, huh? Watch it on a big television screen. Yeah the Guardians film was funnier than most intentional comedies, but it had a heart. Bad guys without friends they may pretend to be, but the Guardians show that they care for each other and for other people, even if they don't say it. Insanely likable characters. Loyalties are a bit confusing at first, but it will be apparent after awhile, unlike some films, where it's painfully clear who's aligned with who from the title sequence. Also, the number of quotable lines within this action film is incredible, rare from a movie with a talking animal character, I know. Halfway through the movie, I wondered when the movie would be over. Except this time, I was hoping that it wouldn't ever end.

242,davideo-2,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1988, the young Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) has just seen his mother die of cancer and, after rushing out the hospital in a flurry of tears, finds himself abducted in to space. Twenty six years later, he's a space hopping, inter-galactic misfit, with a penchant for '70s soul and Motown and is in possession of a special orb, which is wanted by a distant relation of Jim Carrey's The Mask named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who is planning to use it to betray her maniacal ruler Ronan (Lee Pace) who is planning to overtake the universe. But the orb is also wanted by desperate duo Rocket, a talking raccoon, and Groot, a rather monosyllabic talking tree. However, it turns out none of them are entitled to it and they all find themselves thrown in to the jail house, where they cross paths with the strong, silent Drax (Dave Bautista) who has a personal vendetta against Ronan. Together, they must unite together as one and stop his diabolical plan in it's tracks.Guardians of the Galaxy has undoubtedly been the box office hit of the summer. So much so, that even I, on the last day of it's release, have taken a trip out to give it a glance. While the fanfares had died down slightly, it's interesting to chart how over the course of two months, this grandiose offering has taken the film world by storm, a risky venture as well, in as much as there are no established Marvel characters in the lead roles. But simply from the publicity poster, it inflames the senses, with it's dazzling, colourful array of characters and effects. And this would be a real case of reliably judging a book by it's cover, since the film delivers what it promises, a jaw dropping visual spectacle in every sense of the word.Like the previous Marvel encounter, Avenger's Assemble, this doesn't make the mistake of becoming all style over substance, keeping the film flowing with an easy going humour throughout the film that is resplendent with the characters. Pratt's lead is a naturally buffoonish guy through-out the film, who has a wise cracking personality to match, while Cooper's talking raccoon is unavoidably crazy by it's very nature. As for Groot, he's voiced by Diesel, who just says the same line over and over again, which would probably suit his acting ability in more parts where he just appears as himself, although his character here, in the end reel (and throughout really), provides the film with it's more emotional, touching element. These characters are juxtaposed through-out with the more dynamic, forceful character's, in the shape of Saldana's lizard skinned female heroine and Bautista's hard, no nonsense presence. That's not to mention a supporting cast including the likes of Michael Rooker, Djimon Hounsou, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close and Benicio Del Toro.Word of mouth, at least in part, must spread to make something a hit, and in Guardians case it's that it ticks all the right boxes and there's something to appeal to everyone, a lot of effort has been put in to every part of it and it pays off brilliantly. *****",18 October 2014," A sublime assault on the senses, easily the biggest hit of the summer

243,captainconan,"This is the most surprising movies I have ever seen in multiple ways. Not that I thought it was going to be bad. James Gunn was already one of my favorite Writer/Directors of all time. He made quite a few cult classics including one of my favorite movies, Super, which really took me away. Once I knew that James Gunn was directing this, I was skeptical. Having seen his independent films, I knew that him directing a Hollywood movie would either be one of the greatest films of all time, or a complete flop. I was very relieved coming out of the theater that it was the first one. Or I would've been if I hadn't been laughing my *** off at the easter egg.Another reason that I was surprised is that this is a Rocket Raccoon movie. Rocket Raccoon was probably created when someone at Hollywood got high and doodled a Raccoon with a jet pack on. Not to say the comics were bad, it's just that now, Rocket Raccoon is better than The Avengers. And that's saying a lot.The casting, action, comedy, and CGI are all superbly done. There's a ton of comedy, which is made better by the fact that it is good comedy. There's truly stunning special effects, but not too much that this turns into a Michael Bay movie. The action is everything anyone wants from an amazing space opera, but they don't get carried away and end up with a sci-fi Expendables. And everyone plays their various characters incredibly well, even Vin Diesel, who literally only says ""I am Groot"" about fifty times.All in all, I would recommend this to anyone, even people who don't like science fiction or super heroes. This is even family-friendly, and has enough 70's and 80's references to make anyone from that time nostalgic. Any age, any personality, this is the perfect movie for anyone to watch.

Not many knew what to expect with this film considering that the Guardians of the Galaxy were for the most part unheard of characters to the general public. This film did not disappoint in any way. It is by far the greatest Marvel film ever made, downing the Avengers and Days of Future Past.I went into this movie with a feeling that I don't usually get with a film. I knew that this was going to be different and good at the same given time and I was not let down. From the very opening scene to the ending credits, there was not even a second of boredom. To say that this film was entertaining would be putting it under the bus. This film was exhilarating. Never have I seen a film that grasped my attention and kept me in awe from start to finish.As for the technical aspects, this film has the best CGI I have ever seen. Not once did the animation look even relatively fake or cheesy. The CGI will probably revolutionize the field much like 2009's Avatar. I felt as though I could reach out and touch these alien creatures and the amazingly designed ships. The score of the film was beautiful as was the cinematography. There were emotional scenes that were played so well with the score that it was as if they were interchangeable parts that had to be together to work in unison. Every shot of this film was gorgeous and breathtaking. I saw so many things that I have never seen in a film before and for them to capture it so crisply is truly astounding. The acting was very well done by all of the cast members. There may not be any Oscar buzz for the cast, but that doesn't mean that they weren't perfect for their roles. Chris Pratt was genius as Star Lord, Bautista was hilarious as Drax, the Destroyer and Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel did great jobs for voice acting, both being highlights for the film.As far as writing, this movie did something truly unique. it focused on all of the Guardians with equal screen time and equal information of their lives, though Star Lord may have a bit more for obvious reasons. All of the personalities of the main characters were written so well that I forgot for a period of time that it was even a movie. The humor is not dirty (for the most part) and is not slap stick and tiresome. Every scene with humor did its job to make the whole crowd in the theater laugh hysterically. The dialogue was simply that well written.Every aspect of this film was great. Obviously, it isn't a perfect film but it manages to do something that directors have forgotten about. It entertains the audience and that is the sole purpose of the entire film. Films now rely so heavily on art and the director's ideas of ""uniqueness"" that most films are only appreciated by certain groups. Guardians of the Galaxy is a film that anyone can watch and they will enjoy themselves from start to finish and never want to leave the theater.While watching this movie at the opening Friday, I couldn't help but think to myself over and over again that this is the next Star Wars. It has the same chemistry and formula but, in my own opinion, it exceeds the original Star Wars. It is an updated and modern form of that film technique of pure entertainment mixed with humor and character development that adults can relate to as well.It is rare that I say this, but this film will make you cry, make you laugh, make you excited, make you fearful, etc. It is every genre and yet no genre. Guardians is going to be a staple in film and will one day be considered one of the greatest Sci Fi films ever. James Gunn was the director of one of the worst films of 2013 in Movie 43, but he has proved that he is one of the elite despite a horrible effort a year prior.

Yes, I like the big screen sci-fi settings and slick gadgets or impressive superpowers just as much as the next guy. But I'll take emotional engagement over that any day of the week. Make me care enough about the characters to tense up in my seat when they're in danger, to genuinely like them for their unique characteristics, to want to be there in that theatre with them and feeling a bit of a letdown when the movie ends - that's what I love about great movies. Anything short of that, no matter how glitzy, just isn't worth it.I also love good humour in between all that tense action, and this is an area where I think Marvel really shines. I laughed as much as I tensed throughout this movie. To be honest, that's what made me like the main characters as a team so much - their banter was hilarious.True, the plot of this movie is not particularly unique. At its core, its a good guys vs bad guys superhero flick. It's hard to find a truly new story in that dynamic. But as with Jame Cameron films like Avatar, what I like is when the plot is solid enough - when it has no glaring holes - that it doesn't distract you from all the good stuff.All in all, I have to say this: if you're average movie-goer like myself, go see this film.

James Spader took my heart out as Ultron. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen we are also good to look too who were twins in the film want it too destroy Tony Stark and the Avengers. Joss Whedon wrote and directed perfectly this movie. This is a really good movie not better than the first one ""The Avengers"" Is still the best one but this is a still worthy sequel I don't get the hate. Ultron was a bad-ass villain who wanted to destroy our world by creating a global extinction. Excellent performance from James Spader. Excellent performance from Robert Downey Jr. , Chris Evens, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo,, Jeremy Renner and Chris Hemsworth. Right from the comic books Ultron is based on a MARVEL comic book. Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch is a great powerful villain who can control people's mind. Awesome performance from Elizabeth Olsen she is a great babe. James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book superhero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. You have a lots of action in the opening scene you see Captain America with motorcycle just like in the first movie (Captain America: First Avenger). Tony Stark and Bruce Banner create a dormant peacekeeping program called Ultron, things go horribly wrong. Ultron is an artificial intelligence repurposed by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner for a pilot peace program that is overwhelmed with a god complex, and now desires to pacify the Earth by eradicating humanity. To stop him Tony Stark and Bruce Banner create another program and put J.A.R.V.I.S in to the body who becomes Vision his the only one who can stop Ultron by destroying our world.I love how Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow calming The Hulk down. Captain America fights off Ultron on a train a bad ass scene. Black Widow crashes motorcycle and jumps on a truck excellent stunt performance from Scarlett Johansson bad-ass. Iron Man battles The Hulk in a big armored suit. Nick Fury evacuate civilians with his ship Helicarrier while Captain America says I am not leaving this island until everyone is save. Clint Barton saves a young boy when Ultron opens fire at them and Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver jumps in front gun fire and dies saving Hawkeye and a child sacrificing him self. ""The Avengers"" face off against Ultron's army of drones I love the battle on Sokovia city who is moving I love the battle I love how Captain America saves an innocent woman on a bridge collapsing I love that rescue. I love the scenes in which Ultron and Maximoff twins are pursued by ""The Avengers"" too an African shipyard in the base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) to obtain Wakandan vibranium I love the battle there love it. ©The problem with the film I have is it is way too long and they shouldn't have showed Hawkeye's personal life. That he has a wife and two daughters they shouldn't have done that. No one cares. The movie become from time to time boring that's my biggest problem with the film. The rest of the film is perfect 9 at least it is better than Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Guardian of the Galaxy 1 and Vol 2, Doctor Strange, The Incredible Hulk (2008) and many more bad MARVEL films that is my personal opinion.",23 September 2018," Decent, solid good superhero film my personal favorite ""Avengers"" movie off all time

251,ivo-cobra8,"Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a MARVEL damn good superhero flick and an excellent sequel! Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies. This film is fun, popcorn, Action and entertaining action sequel flick. I like the first one but I love this one much more. The first time I watch it, I did not like this film at all, it did not work for me, but the second time around this flick was awesome and it become one of my favorite MARVEL superhero movies. I love this film so much, more than the first Avengers. James Spader made the movie for me! So much better than Loki. 
James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book super hero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. I love this film so much and I will never get the backlash. Joss Whedon gave me everything I wanted in a sequel. This and the first film are in my top 10 films of all time. I waited a long time for this universe and I am loving every minute of it. Superhero movies come out all time but something like this is what I love about movies. 
Plot: Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peace-keeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy's to get. Earth's mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction. I really enjoy this movie I don't get the backslash and a lot of people were disappointed with this sequel that it is not so good as the first film. Age of Ultron is in my top 3 favorite comic book films. Number 1 will always be Captain America: The Winter Soldier and number 2 will be Captain America: The First Avenger, I just love those two films: Captain America is my favorite superhero character in MARVEL comic books. Captain America in this movie is the most decent hero in this movie, he did not want the leave the island with people stuck on it, he refused too, I have seen a hero in him. People are keep getting upset over Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), ""oh look what they did with Black Widow."" I saw the film and I am seeing her kicking ass or calm down the Hulk, which is a pretty ballsy thing to do. Specially for someone who has no balls and she is kicking ass and driving motorcycle, driving around shooting for Cap, helping them to get vision android to beat Ultron and she is the only one with no powers, except Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), she has the to get the thing for them. I think it would be weird to kidnapped Thor, if you put Thor in the scene duh. I enjoy this movie much more than the first film, the first film I liked okay, I like the first Avengers film. This is a fun popcorn entertainment flick that I really love. 
I like the romance between Black Widow with Hulk it was really good fast paced entertainment. I love Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch I like the twist by the end of the film that she turn her side around when she found out that Ultron wants to destroy everything on this planet I love that. You have Aaron Taylor-Johnson in it from Kick-Ass film as Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver sadly he dies on the end of the film, but he saves Hawkeye and a kid from Ultron firing bunch of bullets on them I thought that was pretty decent in the film. In my opinion Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a good job playing his character. I love that they return Samuel L. Jackson to the movie back as Nick Fury and that he help them out fighting Ultron. James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron.Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). You have a lot of action in it, I also love that Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton work together after Ultron failed to destroy them and they go in to safe house to Clinton's family, I like that. When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) touches Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor I like that you see a background of Natasha Romanoff's childhood, I like that. I love the African shipyard you see them on a ship and I love the last stand. I love that the Vision helps Avengers to destroy and stop Ultron from extinction. Btw I love to death Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) she is so beautiful and charming I love her.
Overall: I am giving this flick 10 out of 10 for me Age of Ultron is my #3 favorite super hero movie. I can't wait for the next movie: Captain America: Civil War.",8 May 2016," Avengers: Age of Ultron is a damn good Superhero flick, excellent sequel!

252,reaganrulz49,"The humor, angst and drama are remarkable for a superhero film. In fact, most will consider them remarkable for any type of movie. I can't think of a weak moment in the film, as it is strong from beginning to end. Anyone doubting that this entire cast (new and old) couldn't work well together or that characters would be cheated out of screen time need not worry. EVERYONE gets to shine. Downey as well as Evans are Oscar caliber good in this movie. (Setting up what has to be an amazing next installment in ""Civil War"") All the performances are straight to the point perfect. Hulk is again perfect in his CG transformation and Spader's Ultron uses his wonderful voice and mannerisms to perfection. Each new character is exquisitely cast and the old school guard has never been better. That includes RDJ as Tony Stark. We all loved what we've seen before from him and this evolution of Stark is even more intriguing. Elizabeth Olsen gives one of the best new character portrayals in recent years. People are going to want to see a LOT more of her Scarlet Witch in the future. Also, Jeremy Renner is finally given Hawkeye material worthy of his abilities and worthy of the character itself. He truly does steal more than one scene and has some of the best one-liners imaginable. This easily fulfilled and the exceeded all of my expectations. I can't wait to see where they branch the Avengers team and concept from this point forward. There are so many great possibilities. This really is everything anyone would want in a movie. It delivers everything I had hoped to see and quite a bit that I didn't even think possible.",15 April 2015," Great Film. It easily fulfilled and the exceeded all of my expectations.

253,loserformyself,"I just want to get to the point, this movie is outstanding. This will most likely be the biggest movie of 2015. This is a great movie for those enjoy who action, suspense, and awe worthy moments. This was unbelievably better then the first and I had my doubts but of course Marvel blew me away. I can not even think of one bad thing to say honestly, Marvel knows what to do and how do to do it. If you are a Marvel fan you need to see this movie. I will admit I was a bit upset when I found out Loki/ Tom Hiddleston would not be in this one but Ultorn delivered an amazing performance as well. Get your tickets and get your friends, family, or both because you are in for a huge surprise.",17 April 2015," Amazing.

254,c_razz_y,"Let's just get straight to point here, Avengers Age of Ultron is the best marvel movie to date. You can make a strong argument for it being the best superhero movie of all time. Yes it's really that good. The plot line was very intriguing. It was far from the cliché superhero story. The script was funny and very witty. Joss Whedon did a wonderful job, it's a shame that he won't be directing the next 2 avengers films. The only upside is that he will be still there as a producer for phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This story really sets up phase 3 and one of the most anticipated movies of 2016, Captain America: Civil War. My one regret in terms of the story is that it could be slightly longer, even though the entire film ran smoothly. I would have still liked to see more of the movie, I guess we will have to wait for the DVD release to see some extra scenes. All the actors, unsurprisingly, played their roles superbly. Robert Downey jr again played the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, which we all love. This performance just adds to the argument that he is Iron Man. Chris Evan always brings a sense of honesty and heart to the role of Captain America. Scarlet Johansson again showed us that a male isn't the only one who can be a badass that young boys look up to. Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Samuel L Jackson, Jeremy Renner, Cobie Smulders, Don Cheadle and Anthony Mackie all reprised their roles wonderfully and each one of them added an extra dimension to their character. The newcomers Thomas Kretschmann, Andy Serkis, Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson were all great additions to the already extremely talented and lively cast. The newcomer that really gave the strongest performance was clearly James Spader. His intimidating robotic voice really brought the character to life and added sense of realism, in an otherwise unbelievable character. He brought our future fears (from terminator) of an AI trying to wipe out humanity. Marvel are not known for their memorable super villains, in fact they're known for the opposite of this, but this villain is up there with Loki, Ultron is one of the more terrifying and surprisingly relatable/understandable villains in the MCU. However Paul Bettany's performance as the vision stole the show. He took the spotlight for every scene that he was in and I can't wait to see him again. The cast really gel well as a unit and you'll be thinking that these actors grew up with each other, after you've seen the movie. The chemistry between everyone holds the film together. The action in the movie, let's just make this quick, was mind blowing. For anyone who's seen the trailers, you will already know that the action shown was amazing. For any of you that think that they've showed too much or every action piece, from the movie, in the trailers, you couldn't be more wrong. When you watch the movie you'll notice that the action scenes are orchestrated beautifully and that every character has upped their game since the last time we saw them on screen, especially Captain America. This is a big budget movie and this is clearly shown in the stunts and the action sequences. The movie was shot all over the world this time and that helps to show that these group of people don't just fight for one nation but the world. The locations were beautiful and i will always prefer a real natural set over a green screen. This movie was a fantastic treat to watch and it's really a shame that this movie wasn't longer, so that we could all enjoy it for 20-30 minutes more. I had high expectations coming into the theatre and when I left, I was more than satisfied. This movie will be enjoyed by people of all ages, it's got cool action for the kids and the plot is more than interesting enough to hold the attention of the adults. This movie delivers on all levels and can be considered as one of the best, if not the best movie of all time. It's clearly the best movie in the past few years. P.S. Stay for after the movie ends (mid-credits) for a treat for phase 3. I will be uploading a video review to this movie soon. Please subscribe to my channel and watch the videos already posted.

255,BigTenPower,"What's the old saying? ""Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see."" Well, Joss Whedon is officially a genius and the talent of this cast was evident in every scene. They all hit it out of the park. Yes, I just love Avengers Age of Ultron. This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on absolutely all of your emotions. The last time I enjoyed a movie this much was the last time these characters assembled. Again, they managed to deliver a remarkable cool factor. What makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Winter Soldier delivered conspiracy thrills. The Iron Man trilogy factored in Tony Stark's complete dramatic arc, character flaws and all. The Dark World was pure sci-fi fantasy. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted is an extra special treat. It all works so well and is grounded enough to carry the story and the audience through an unbelievable ride. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's an exciting symphony and that dichotomy and difference in characters and how they interact are what makes this movie truly great. It's why Avengers stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, Fast/Furious, and even Star Wars or Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and even multiple genres all by itself. It delivers depth of character with its fun and amazing action sequences. There's a reason why these movies make as much money as they do. They deliver a lot of everything and do so at a high quality.Right from the beginning of the movie, where we get the all in one tracking shot, through the epic final globe smashing conclusion, everything is on go and everything delivers superb intensity and spectacle. This is going to be many many people's favorite film of 2015.",20 April 2015," I just love Avengers Age of Ultron! Such a superb sequel.

256,animallover1136,"Avengers Assemble! Earth's mightiest heroes team up once again to defeat a new threat, one originally created for change. Unlike in the comics, Tony Stark creates Ultron rather than Hank Pym (Ant-Man). Tony's invention overrides it's original settings, Ultron having a mind of his own--thinking that change means the planet should be covered with metal minions and not human beings. ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was absolutely stunning, with many great comedic jokes and moments, more character development involving some of the most secret-keeping of characters, new and old faces on screen, the element of surprise, plenty of great action and many elements from the comic books.

I enjoyed the fight scenes immensely, with one in particular that had me grinning like the Cheshire cat.Fans of the Marvel movies will already know what to expect from Thor, Iron man and Captain America, and the real delight for me came from the new arrivals, especially Paul Bettany as Vision.The Real highlight for me was the villain Ultron. The way he looks and moves combined with the amazing voice from James Spader gives Ultron real screen presence and a great sense of menace that sets it apart from other robots in film.The only thing I would have changed in this movie was to give Anthony Mackie a bigger part in it because i really enjoyed his performance in Captain America: the Wintrr Soldier, and was disappointed not to have him alongside Chris Evans again where he seemed to fit perfectly in his previous appearance.

258,davidjr2008,"I was reading some of the post and seemed very surprised at the few low ratings , I know you can't please everyone. All of the fighting scenes were spectacular I never got bored , even through the slower parts I enjoyed the whole movie. I think that the humor in it was great , and realistic . You get that much testosterone in a group everyone will try to one up everyone else, In real life as well. I saw it in iMax(the huge screens) 3D , so that definitely added to the excitement , I don't go see movies any more in regular screen ever since imax 3D. I strongly recommend going to see it like that ! It is an unforgettable experience. Also on a side note guys that get disappointed I don't feel bad for because just like with everything in life if you expect something a certain way and it doesn't meet your expectations you are going to get let down ! But if you have none or at the very least lower your expectations you will see how much of a difference it is . Go in with an open mind , don't be so closed minded people.

259,rannynm,"The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we're given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes. There are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you're pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We're given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions. I love this movie not only because it's a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I'm excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe. Marvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters. For people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past. The action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America's shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.My favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful. There are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, ""get acquainted"" with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they're unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn't matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on. The moral of the film is, ""The way to peace is not destruction."" Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man. I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle.

260,engrymfilm,"Where to start? First of all, Mrs. Joss Whedon you've done it again! I've been following this sh'man's work since Buffy and I still can't believe how consistently great, elegant, poetic, graceful, romantic, feminine yet hard, brutal, no holds barred, slamming, thrusting, dominating and masculating sh'is material has been. I come from a long line of men and women in my family and growing up around a strong female character such as my mother and a submissive yet nice guy character as my Dad, I came into my own character... I mean identity early in life. I understood immediately how a relationship between a man and a woman works and so began my long, hard, soft and wet foray into the more tasteful and equal parts of the artistic world in such mediums as cinema (or ""Kino"" for all you Krauts!), music, books, paintings, graphic novels, bicycles, cats and ethnic food. This path eventually led me to the works of Joss Whedon. And this Whoa-Man (as in he's such a good writer it makes you go ""WHOA, MAN!"" but it's also a pun of the word woman because that's his favorite word) has taken the helm of Marvel's ultimate team of Superheroes: The Avengers! So here's the deal: How does Whedon write such strong female characters? You have Black Widow and let's be honest, even though her screen time and salary is a fraction of her male co-stars she still kicks ass as in the woman can really fight! But wait, it doesn't end there because we're introduced to Scarlet Witch and guess what? she kicks ass, too in her collected 10 minutes of screen time! she has strong, telekinetic, female character powers. And let's not forget S.H.I.E.L.D Agent Maria Hill who only has a combined screen time of maybe 5 minutes in a 140 minute movie but you know what? when she shows up, she kicks ass! There's so much girl power in this movie that you instantly forget that the rest of the characters taking up a majority of the film's running time are male. But we have a big bad wolf in the film's main villain: Ultron. This pulsing man-machine symbol of the Patriarchy is on a throbbing rampage to destroy the entire world. Typical male, am I right? *owl face. Ultron tears and rips through so many walls, pounding and destroying whatever is spread out in front of him you almost think no one has a chance.Then something glorious happens in the character of Vision. Like an angel he gracefully enters an opening in the story with such a delicate touch, slow yet careful and with passion and a most extreme sensual connection he helps the Avengers to defeat Ultron. But of course it wouldn't be Whedon if a woman wasn't there to aid him because Scarlet Witch is also a big factor in the big, exploding climax. She absolutely gushes with such power that the combined force of her and Vision opens up a whole new, unlabeled form of partnership that has yet to buzz up in our own society. These characters are the absolute objects of my affectionIf you want a definition of Whedon's artistic vision you would be wrong to think it was lumpy, pasty, receding in quality, or sausagely-fingered in its themes as that would be shaming his entire body of work. His career is to define what it is to be a woman and I haven't seen equality like this since the outcome of Roe v Wade. The Bodhi Dharma once said: ""Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it"". I imagine when he put down his writing chopstick afterwards he never would have thought his words would give a natural birth to the baby mind of one Joss Whedon. Keep on writing, Mister Sister 'cuz, baby, you're a firefly!",17 April 2015," And I'm sitting here wishing this liberal masterpiece wasn't over!

261,palavitsinis,"Well, I watched it last night and I am still amazed and thinking about it! Truly one of the greatest marvel movies. I read some of the negative reviews from other users and I have to say that I don't understand them. Sometimes it feels like they paid a ticket to see a marvel movie, and then they expected some kind of Oscar winning performance and some deep and meaningful life-inspiring story. No. That's not it. If you expect that, look for another movie. For me, this kind of movies is like having single-flavor smoothies, like lemon or orange or strawberry, and then, one day a guy comes and says, ""do you want them all in one?"". That's actually it. Iron man, Thor, Hulk and Captain America, some very successful characters, all-in-one! What more can you ask for? I really liked the depiction of the different characters and how they all blended and interact with one another. It's really nice how each character keeps its own uniqueness and how they also blend together, creating some amazing moments. I really appreciated the humor of the movie which was really useful to break the tension in many points during the story. The Ultron was AMAZING as a villain as well as the Vision. The movie was packed with action and had an amazing flow that made you think you were already 1h30m into the movie, when it was actually only 45 minutes. Scenes that were too much even for such a movie were significantly less than the first movie.

262,quargelbrot,"Nothing more, nothing less.Hollywood was out of idead, until Marvel became company with Disney and created a masterplan for a saga containing some of the greatest stories in comicbook-history onto celluloid...a few years ago everyone would have said: ""Impossible to do"".Now the Infinity-Gauntlet-story gets more and more real, including the Civil-Wars, Ragnarök and more of the most complex comicbook- sagas into ONE big masterplan.Every other studio tries no to create it's own universe, it revoluted blockbuster-history, and I dare to say it saved cinema for a long time.AoU is no exception: (I want to exclude spoilers) So many big names, characters and story are meanwhile puzzled to one highly anticipated climax, which becomes reality in a few years.I'm deeply impressed and say one thing to the Americans, who will see AoU from next week on: The first Avengers was a small French comedy compared to AoU.It's spectacular, overloaded and FULLY comic-related.Of course there are plot holes, logical errors etc., that's cinema. But the way HOW the story evolves to a common sense, the way it was planned before, the way fresh characters continue hooking on the Saga-train...there is no comparable example to this.The MCU and the Infinity-Gauntlet-story has it's place in Cinema- history already.Of course DC can make it better, there is still improvement-space left.

Nervous because I wasn't sure about the Twins, whether I would like them or not, and because the first movie was so great that it was hard to picture a better one. Well..I was wrong!!so wrong. This movie is one of those you need to see more than once. The characters are,as usual,amazing, but they've evolved since Avengers and are much,much better. In Avengers it felt that some members of the team were more important than others, in this movie they're all equally awesome in their own ways. The action..THE ACTION, from beginning to end is non-stop, the movie begins and ends with action scenes,one better than the previous one. And lastly, the comic reliefs, I remember laughing plenty in Avengers but in this movie it's one joke after the other and they're all awesome! There were some people who complained about all the sneak peaks,saying that it showed too much, let me tell you,you will encounter a lot of things in the movie that you probably weren't expecting, in a good way. One piece of advice: What Whedon said is true, there is no after- credit scene(I stayed till the end just to be sure)but there is one AMAZING mid- credit scene.

264,westfield-john,"Don't expect me to write something as easy and liquid as this movie is. It is popcorn cinema at its best. The story? A bunch of co(s)mic based super heroes and super villains choose to fight about...something. a bucket of possibilities come into my mind, the world, justice, a city, a nation, whatever. Take what you like. The holy grail of shallow cinema. Well, if this would be everything, we would have been happy with Indiana Jones and all about it for the rest of our humble lives. But Indiana Jones isn't this interwoven into our modern world. We are obliged into value based thinking. Everything is of a certain value. Mixed with strong moral based and ethic principles, so we don't freak out. Our way of living is a modern tale, our ego is of value. And tales, as they were used through all times in history, do emphasize on a certain aspect. They offer a different view on real life circumstances, we cant easily describe else. And this is what The Avengers does. They are the perfect image of our principles, of our lives, how we are supposed to be in order to succeed in our lives, in business, in enterprises, in companies, in public places, at the grocery, at home, in our families, even on the toilet. Serve and protect. Love your next like your beloved brother. And you know this isn't easy, to keep the toilet clean with a brush after using it. So are the Avengers, they are always fighting on screen with uttermost force. And they do cause tremendous havoc. But this is just the image of what is unseen in our real life. Unseen because of the conservative and stodgy chair we took place in. And this movie is a tribute to this injustice. I am able to smile at my children when they play supercherios, marvel & crapman. They do honor me! All of them. And I know it. We are the Marvels. They are our inner heroes. Fighting every day for the good in this world, in all of us. A homage to you, as you would never dare to show to anyone, even not yourself. No need to see a shrink anymore. Watch the Avengers, watch all the Marvel Superheroes. You deserve it.

265,skoobydoo6789,"After the release of the Avengers in 2012, I excitedly waited the release of its sequel. It set the bar very high. Age of Ultron did not disappoint me at all. I enjoyed every moment of it. I went to see the Avengers sequel at a 7:00 pm IMAX 3-D showing a day early.In Age of Ultron, the Avengers finally turned into a team that works well together. They have been tracked down HYDRA facilities after the fall of SHIELD as shown in Captain America-Winter Soldier. In one mission, they run into Baron Von Strucker and the Maximoff twins (Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch). After finding Loki's scepter from the first Avengers movie, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner use it to create the artificial intelligence, Ultron. Like in other movies with AI, Ultron goes rogue.Ultron's plan causes him to butt heads with the Avengers. It also leads up to the creations of the Vision. It's great how the Vision and Ultron have contrasting views of the world and the human race. The movie does a great job of keeping the audience's attention. It has a pretty good story. Also, Age of Ultron has a lot of funny moments that everyone will like.The movie, like the first Avengers movie, has an amazing cast that works well with each other. I liked the newcomers in the movie as well. The actors who played Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great in their respective roles. The best part of the movie is James Spader. He steals the show every time he shows up as Ultron. By the end of the movie, everyone was clapping. Age of Ultron is worth seeing and a great sequel to the first Avengers movie.",1 May 2015," Brilliant sequel

How do you expect the story to progress if you just want to see the same Avengers one movie in 2nd one as well? The problem here is think that no one wants to see a super hero having an emotional side and a their own life. If first movie was about getting them together, 2nd movie is about exploring them beyond their superhero facet. One cant help but feel bad for Bruce Banner and Natasha for all they wanted was little more life than being bad-ass superheros but can only dream about it. The beautiful sibling bonding between Scarlett witch and quick silver.Tony setting the stage for another war with ""accidental"" creation Evil AI Ultron.

267,kingfishfilmco,"When I first saw this in the theatre, I thought it was too busy and Spader was a little cartoony. But on first viewing you're always comparing it to the original, so you need a time to step back. Now, I see how well written it is and how the humor really fits perfectly, considering Ultron is Stark's alter ego. I also never really thought much of Scarlett as an actor, but her scene at the beginning with the lullaby really showed an incredible range of emotions in just a small scene with great subtly. All of this is a result of great writing, both in story line and dialog, along with everyone of the actors being first rate. I'm glad to finally see comic book movies reaching the intelligence of their source material. I'm not a comic book geek but a movie lover, so I don't have any of the preconceived prejudices.

Enjoy the movie for what it is. Super heroes movies will never stay true to the comics reason why is because maybe the comic storyline won't work either for the motion picture. The movie was great, excellent action and fighting. I like how the story is going so far and how well the balance between the characters are with each other.

270,kieranbattams,"Once in a while a film comes around which raises your expectations so high and excites so much that it seems they cannot be exceeded so simply. Yet we are talking about a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie here, full of the fun, humour and characters that have never failed to disappoint before. I can safely say that my reasoning for Avengers Age of Ultron being my most anticipated film for 3 years is totally justified and it did not disappoint in any way. The emotions it left me feeling were some of the best i have felt for a long time and throughout i was smiling and felt like i was a member of the team Marvel have spent so long building up, and they are very much a team here taking us on a journey much bigger than the first and in many ways better.The film opens with an incredible action sequence and stays that way until the very end of the post-credits scene which has become a staple at the very core of Marvel. Here Tony Stark has been working on a dormant peace keeping programme that is set to save the world so that the Avengers aren't needed anymore and can take a well deserved break. Enter Ultron, played as perfectly as a fan could wish for with the chilling voice of James Spader who gives real depth to a character who had to be done right to be brought to the screen. The Avengers assemble once again to counter Ultron who sees them as the only threat to the world he is sworn to protect and on the way encounter twins Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver who are insanely awesome characters. A lot of fans worried that Aaron-Taylor Johnson would be a disappointment compared to the perfect portrayal in last years Xmen film but i can say safely that they are two very different takes on Quicksilver and that they both did absolutely brilliant jobs. Elisabeth Olsen as Scarlett Witch again also provides us with a huge deal of depth and really makes the character her own. I must say though whilst everybody in the film, and i mean everybody, did a phenomenal job the standout is definitely Paul Bettany as the Vision. Without spoilers i can say without a doubt that he is the best character for me and is brought to the screen as perfectly as anyone could have imagined to counter the bad-ass Ultron. Joss Whedon gives it his all and that is definitely no understatement.Each Avenger has their own demons to battle and we get to know them so much better than we already did. In particular what i loved was firstly the relationship between not only Bruce Banner and Black Widow but also the relationship she had with the Hulk. They played off each other so well. Black Widow really got to shine here. We knew the back stories of the Avengers because we got to see them in standalone films but hers is finally told to us and Scarlett Johansson brings a real feel of emotion to her character that we haven't previously gotten to know. We also get Thor who has demons to battle and we see more of an insight as to what is going on in his head and Captain America who is coming to grips with the life he has been given in modern times which was explored subtlety but very well. Also i know you are all wondering, yes the Iron man Hulkbuster vs Hulk fight was incredible and nothing short of spectacular. I loved Hulk in this film as he was more than the muscle of the team and the fight with Stark was given context instead of being thrown in for the fun of it (but that doesn't mean it isn't fun). Plus i was very happy to see Hawkeye was given a huge deal of screen time, he was bad-ass and shone a new light on him as a character which was awesome.A couple minor flaws, but they are minor are that Ultron did have less screen time than i hoped. He was awesome but you almost want to see more by the conclusion. Also the post-credits scene was pretty cool but so short and i just wish i could have seen a little more in terms of set-up. Other than that you will not find a better time at the cinema and i doubt that will change for the rest of the year.Avengers Age of Ultron is without a doubt my number one MCU film and featured all the action, humour and characters that we are promised and more. War Machine even shows up for the fun as well as Falcon even if only for a small time. Plus Nick Fury was as great as ever. All balanced with a slight dose of dark elements and we are given the perfect summer movie to enjoy again and again. Will be seeing it again on Sunday for sure. I am in love with everything about this film at the minute including the incredible soundtrack. ""Didn't see that coming?"" Neither did i.

271,cerca-sonia,"I used to think making a better film than the Avengers was quite impossible, but Joss Whedon did it! Avengers: Age of Ultron is a dream come true, the sequel all the fans were waiting for, and inarguably the best Marvel film to date - maybe even better than Guardians of the Galaxy. The film still has all the elements of the first film, but it makes a huge step forward in the action - the 3D vision is totally worthy - dialogue and character. However, the main difference is the villain: James Spader's Ultron is marvelous. The talk about artificial intelligence is very fascinating, both conceptually and cinematically.The storyline is far from the cliché superhero story. The script is great and amusing. The direction of Joss Whedon is flawless. There is a great balance within the Avengers, where the superiority of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk is perfectly balanced with the more active roles of Black Widow and Hawkeye - I would have loved to see more Falcon though. I loved what they did with The Vision, The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. All the actors gave a fantastic performance. Robert Downey Jr. keeps on playing the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist in a way nobody else could. Chris Evans always brings a sense of honor to his character. Scarlett Johansson really surprised me. Great performances also from Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Paul Bettany. Elizabeth Olsen gives one of the best new character portrayals in recent year - I really want to see more of her Scarlet Witch. However, James Spader totally steals the scene: he is perfect.More at afilmadaybysonia.blogspot.com",23 April 2015," A dream come true!

272,sonofodin25,"Wow. Just Wow. Marvel actually did, they made a movie that may have topped all of their other movies. (Cap 2 is the only real competition). So, Avengers: Age Of Ultron begins with a bang, literally, the first ten minutes are this massive Avengers Vs. Hyrda action sequence that is out of this world. Here we see Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye re-assemble for one of the most exiting, squeal worthy movie scenes ever. This scene also introduces us to two new characters, Quicksilver (who Movie Buffs already know from ""X-Men: Days Of Future Past"") and his twin sister, The Scarlet Witch. At first I was sceptical about these two, however as the movie progressed they slowly became some of my favourite ""Avengers"" characters. Another thing that I found cool about these two is that their powers are quite different and something that separates them and this movie from the Original Avengers. Making for some awesome visual effects.As usual with these movies, the actors completely nail their roles. Even after all these years Robert Downey Jr. just IS Tony Stark, he once again owns the role and completely redeems the character after the horror that was ""Iron Man 3"". Chris Evans once again completely owns the role of Captain America, perfectly portraying both his old-fashion ideals and his completely bad-ass side perfectly. The other stand-out of the movie, one whom I did not expect, was Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. That's right, Hawkeye, who was formerly Marvel's worst adaptation of a comic character after the Mandarin, is now awesome. He finally gets a back-story and motivation for his character and just kills it. Also, Hawkeye, much like his comic book-counter part, gets the funniest lines in the movie. (""I could do it, No one would know""). I could right about how every actor is perfect forever, but it would take me too long, these 3 (and another who I will get to later) are the stand-outs of the film, however the others all portray their characters to perfection as well (especially Chirs Hemsworth, Elizabeth Olsen, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson).Now the biggest change from the comics is for sure the personality of Ultron, it is to be expected seeing as in the movie Ultron's personality was based off of Tony Stark instead of Hank Pym. I however came to accept this version of Ultron. James Spader was just born to play (voice) this role. I felt for Ultron and understood his motivations and why he wanted to do what he did. I even felt sympathy for his character in certain parts of this movie. He see's humanity through a fresh, un-biased set of eyes and doesn't agree with modern-civilization. I will say that Ultron may have had one to many joke-lines, but I can cope with it. Now Thor, Ultron, Hawkeye and The Scarlet Witch are all great but my favourite character in the movie was by far The Vision, played by Paul Bettany. I don't want to give to much away about this character, but he is just brilliant and I can't wait to see more of him.The only reason I gave the movie 9 instead of 10 (It would be like a 9.5 if I had that option) was because it did feel a little rushed. I feel sorry for the non-Marvel fans going into the theatre as they may have trouble understanding what's going on. I've heard that the original cut was about 3 and half hours and you really can tell that they cut things out, that being said I've also heard that an extended edition will be released, and I think that version of the movie may become my favourite movie of all time.Overall, Avengers: Age Of Ultron is just about as good as a superhero movie can get it makes you laugh, cry, squeal in nerd-glee, and then at the end leaves you dying for more.

273,Anurag-Shetty,"Avengers: Age of Ultron continues with the story of the Avengers, who are Earth's mightiest heroes. The team consists of Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) & Clint Barton/Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner). After the events of The Avengers(2012), Iron Man 3(2013), Thor: The Dark World(2013) & Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), the Avengers are hot on the trail of Loki's scepter which is in the hands of HYDRA. Due to all the attacks on Earth in recent times, Tony Stark believes that the world needs additional protection, other than the Avengers. He convinces Dr. Bruce Banner to help him build Ultron(James Spader), a sentient robot that can protect the Earth & help the Avengers to stop any global threat. However, things don't quite go as planned. Ultron has a warped perception of the world & the Avengers. He wants all the Avengers extinct & has diabolical plans for the Earth. Now, it is up to the Avengers to stop Ultron before it's too late. However, it won't be easy as Ultron has the help of twins with incredible powers. They are Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver(Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who has the power of super speed & Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olsen) who has the power of telekinesis & mind control. Avengers: Age of Ultron is an incredibly epic film! It surpasses its predecessor in every way possible! My expectations for this movie were through the roof. I kept thinking to myself, there's no way that it can surpass the highest grossing superhero movie of all time. I was wrong. Joss Whedon has outdone himself. He has truly made a bigger & better film. Sure, the formula is the same as the first movie but, everything is ten times better. Besides, only the basic idea remains the same. The climax of the movie is significantly different. The camaraderie among the Avengers has increased. There are plenty of memorable scenes with all of them together. Though this film is darker, the humor that all the Marvel movies are known for, is intact. There are plenty of witty one-liners that will make you guffaw from time to time. Plus, if you enjoyed the squabbling among the various Avengers in the first film, don't fret. There's plenty of that, this time around too. I loved the fact that our heroes travel the globe & are not just stuck in New York where almost all superhero movies take place. The special effects are otherworldly. Each action set-piece is more fantastic & thrilling than the last. Two of my most favorite sequences are the Hulk vs. the Hulkbuster showdown & the climax of the movie. The 3D is eye-popping & has been put to good use throughout the film. This movie wouldn't be half as incredible without the superb performances from the stellar cast. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. After so many portrayals of this character, Downey Jr.'s performance seems effortless. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Hemsworth balances the God of Thunder's wit & seriousness with ease. Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. Ruffalo's killing it as both the mild mannered scientist & the 'other guy'. The motion capture for the Hulk is extremely realistic. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans keeps getting better & better with each portrayal of America's first superhero. Scarlett Johansson is amazing as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Johansson portrays a more vulnerable Nat, this time around. Jeremy Renner is great as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. I loved that Renner's character is given more importance in this sequel. Aaron Taylor-Johnson & Elizabeth Olsen are super as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver & Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. The Maximoff twins are a welcome addition to the Avengers universe. Paul Bettany is excellent & unrecognizable as Jarvis/Vision. James Spader is the perfect combination of intimidating, powerful, terrifying & funny as Ultron. All the ingredients that make the ideal villain. Spader's deep baritone & trademark drawl are perfect for the voice of Ultron. Cobie Smulders is impressive as Maria Hill. Samuel L. Jackson is perfect as Nick Fury. Many key players in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have cameos. They are good too. Joss Whedon & the entire cast & crew of Avengers: Age of Ultron, take a bow. Avengers: Age of Ultron is a masterpiece. Go for it now!",24 April 2015," Exceeded my expectations in every way. The best superhero movie of all time!

This sequel was better in all the right ways you WANT a film to be better, for example all the jokes was REALLY funny, not the ones you see in certain movies where they try so hard but often fail, no in this one there was several times when most of the audience laughed out loud and they really nailed the fun stuff!!There was not the ""30-40minutes"" non-stop meaningless action/fighting scenes that just steals away precious minutes of the film that some movies also have these days, this movie have in my opinion instead succeeded with having balanced the exact right amount of story/action. It never gets boring due to the lack of action or other way around to much story without action.. This is also the first movie that is +2h long that i didn't feel when the ending was near that ""oh no, has it already been 2h 20minutes"" i wanted it to be ""more"" and longer.. All the hobbit movies gave me that feeling although they all have more running time, so when you leave the theater after watching this im pretty sure you will feel like this one was not to long or to short.. A brilliant film in all ways.. Deserves a 10 in my opinion and i can promise that it will not disappoint you in any way. A movie you easy can take your gf with you to watch since there is a intense and good story behind it and its funny.

It was directed by Peyton Reed who previously directed Bring It On my all time favorite teen comedy movie. He directed brilliant the film. Paul Rudd is Scott Lang/ Ant-Man a master thief who becomes a new MARVEL superhero. Paul Rudd helped writing a screenplay for his character he was playing. There was 4 screen writers working on a script for this movie, that is why the movie turned out so good. I never heard before about Ant-Man but my coworker did heard about the ""smallest superhero"" Ant-Man. It is a good solid, decent intelligent origin story about redemption that is a kick-ass bad-ass movie. I have enjoy it very much.After in 1989 Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) invents a serum and formula for Ant-Man suit and resigns from Howard Stark S.H.I.E.L.D.. In the present day Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former assistant and brilliant scientist Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the ""Yellowjacket"", which horrifies Pym. Because Cross almost figure it out a formula from Hank Pym for his Ant-Man shrink suit. Hank Pym recruits Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) a master thief who breaks in to his vault and steal his suit. Hank decides to give Scott Lang a chance to redeem him self and get him in to the suit. Hank becomes Scott's mentor so that Scott will break and steal in to Cross Technological Enterprises and destroy all the data base and steal the ""Yellowjacket"" suit that Darren Cross invented. With the support and help from Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Hank Pym's estranged daughter and help with his there friends Luis (Michael Peña), Kurt (David Dastmalchian) and Dave (T.I.), Ant-Man goes on a deadly mission for his own redemption of his daughter. This Is a decent marvel film about the smallest superhero. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon is in this movie as one of the Avengers who is guardian Avengers building in which Scott Lang/Ant-Man has to break in to facility to steal a little technology because they need it to break in to Cross Technological Enterprises. Great fight sequence with Ant-Man and Falcon kick-ass. I never expect to be this movie so good: Scott Lang is an ex systems engineer at VistaCorp and petty criminal who served time in prison I would say 3 years in San Quentin State Prison. Scott decides to steal Ant-Man suit to support his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). But since he broke out from jail and her step father who is a cop pursuing him. Scott Lang has only one chance to be in her daughter's life REDEMPTION.Michael Douglas was awesome as mentor Dr. Hank Pym and father figure to Scott Lang. Paul Rudd was fantastic as Scott Lang/Ant-Man he was also in Captain America: Civil War in Captain America Team. Evangeline Lilly was great as Hope van Dyne she was good at her role. Corey Stoll is a terrific bad guy as Yellowjacket who wanted to kill Cassie (Scott Lang's) daughter and Ant-Man goes to save her. Michael Pena as Luis is great in this movie I love him like he saved that security guard decent. The fight sequences between Yellowjacket and Ant-Man is excellent comes handy in the movie hand to hand combat. This is like I would watch Aliens (1986) my favorite film of all time.

279,misterembryo,"Ant-Man must have been a challenge for these filmmakers. The preceding films from the Avengers Universe featured an epic roster of out-of-this-world heroes whose names alone make you tinkle a little: IRON MAN, THOR, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and then there's Ant-Man. (Womp-womp) While die-hard fans of the comics would recognize Ant-Man as an original member of the ensemble, the general audience may be left to wonder WTF?!Ant-Man, do you even lift, Bro?The filmmakers must have been aware of this, considering the tongue-in-cheek treatment of the script. With a screenplay largely penned by Shaun of the Dead legend Edgar Wright, and built upon by other great comedic writers, Joe Cornish (Attack the Bock), Adam McKay (Anchorman), and Ant-Man himself Paul Rudd, Ant-Man does indeed do some heavy lifting, delivering one of the funniest, most entertaining, and visually satisfying superhero movies to date.The ant super-suit is sick. Red and silver with bulging insectoid eyes, it looks like a modern day motocross version of the Japanese monster slayer Ultraman. As soon as he hits the shrink button, you are sucked into a world so awesome you have no choice but to brace yourself and see where the ride takes you. Stan Lee wanted to make this movie in the 80's but ironically Disney, the production company behind today's Ant-Man, already had a shrinking movie of its own in the works. While ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" was amazing in its time, I couldn't be happier that they waited for the movie effects of today to let Ant- Man zip this way and that, from our world to the minuscule one and back. Coincidentally an ant saved the kids from a giant scorpion in that Rick Moranis classic, and in Ant-Man the ants also play a major role in saving the day. That's right. His power is not only to shrink to the size of an ant, but also to control an army of them. In that respect, this movie is unlike any superhero movie you've ever seen.The Pym Particle, created by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) has the ability to shrink a living human being. Think of the possibilities! Microsurgery, mobility, and of course, warfare! The latter makes Dr. Pym realize just how dangerous this technology really is and he decides to cease research and development altogether. Years pass, and the existence of this technology is reduced to a myth. What Dr. Pym didn't know is that his own assistant Darren Cross (Corey Stoll, House of Cards) had been obsessing over this myth and has been trying to replicate this technology on his own. Stoll has a unique ability to make you sympathize for his character at times, but can also be straight up scary.Dr. Pym and his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly, Lost) know they have to stop Cross but keep butting heads. Hope is a badass, but Pym refuses to let her get involved, which reveals some deeper, more serious daddy issues. Their only hope is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, my man crush), an ex-convict who was a professional burglar, not a robber because Lang insists that implies physical violence, and he's not about that life. To pull off the job, Lang enlists his original heist crew, played by David Dastmalchian, Rapper T.I., and Michael Peña, who offers some of the most hilarious scenes in the movie. What ensues is an adventure, a comedy, an action movie and a heist rolled into one Little Debbie oatmeal cookie crumb of elephantine excitement and pure elation. If you haven't noticed, I like this movie.Close friends may say I am biased because it stars Paul Rudd, whom I have been enamored with ever since Clueless. When Cher realized she was in love with Josh, I too realized Paul Rudd is my number one man crush. Let me close this by taking a moment to acknowledge how perfect Paul Rudd is in the role of Scott Lang/Ant-Man. He is a master at self-deprecating humor, as seen in movies like ""I Love You, Man"" and ""Knocked Up"" and his role as Mike Hannigan on ""Friends."" This is a necessity when you see how Ant-Man may have somewhat of a Napoleon Complex when he inevitably has to measure up against the mighty Avengers. Paul Rudd has shown his chops as a dramatic actor in movies like ""The Shape of Things"" and ""Admission,"" and again here in Ant- Man as an estranged father, who wants nothing more than to spend more time with his daughter Cassie. While elements of his various roles can be seen in Ant-Man this was nothing like anything Paul Rudd has ever done before, and he pulled it off.His dedication can be seen not only in the moment that reveals his handsomely chiseled abs. In preparation for the role, Paul Rudd bought an ant farm to study. Even after he finished shooting, he decided to keep it. Just when you thought you couldn't fall in love with Paul Rudd any further. On the week the movie was released, Paul Rudd earned a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and deservedly so. Somehow it's not the star that immortalizes him in film history. It's his stellar performance in Ant-Man, the movie that will shrink and find its way into your heart and stay there forever.",19 July 2015," Ant-icipation is over. I Love You, Ant-Man.

280,adamsmith-51004,I am a big superhero fan both DC and Marvel. Recently though I have found some of the superhero movies a bit hit and miss and not as great as some people have made out. I was lucky enough to win tickets to see the premier of this film in 3D. I went in quite positive as I had seen the trailers of this movie and enjoyed them. Well after seeing this movie I can honestly say I enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy. Paul Rudd did a great job of being a guy who is struggling in life and made some bad decisions even if they were for good intentions. He got the humour right and played the action right as well. Michael Douglas was well cast as Hank Pym and the story was really good from start to finish. The humour in this film was brilliant and done in the right areas of the film. The visuals are fantastic and the scenes where Paul Rudd is learning to become Ant Man as well as the fight scenes are top notch and when he shrinks to ant size you really do believe it is real. I thoroughly recommend seeing this film as it stands out well as it's own movie rather than a stepping stone to others. All Marvel fans and superhero fans need to see this. Here is hoping they do all films as good as this in the future,12 July 2015," A refreshing Marvel movie

281,chuwawah-919-385097,"'All good things comes in small packages' 'It's not the quantity it's the quality' 'Never judge a book by its cover' - True say! This little gem took me by surprise and I am glad I finally went and watched this movie as it was not on my priority list. It was released exactly a month ago, with very little hype. The only reason Ant Man caught my attention was because as an unlimited card holder I get to see trailers months before they are due to be released. Otherwise, I would have quite easily missed this film on the big screen. Why? I think because it was not hyped up enough.Marvel Comics are well known for superheroes that have eye catching suits, skills and ability; they are huge and not just on their egos. They very rarely come singular, most times in pairs or in fours. They have weapons and very large,techy vehicles to wet the audience's appetite.What does Ant-Man have? Well, he does have a suit that allows him to skilfully shrink in size whilst increasing his strength. He has a senseof humour only a naive thief will get. And that's where his 'jail friends' come in; there is something cute about men who are 'thick as 2 planks put together'. And as for the vehicle, well what could Ant- Man possibly have other than #247, the winged carpenter ant called 'Anthony ' and that's all is needed to 'make mountain out of a mole hill'.Antastic! Fab performance by Paul Rudd as Ant-Man/Scott Lang. He had an innocent charm about him. I loved Michael Pena as Luis who just gave us something to laugh about every minute. Ant-Man was cleverly made;immersing you into the minute world beneath our feet, looking up it can be scary but the action just kept rolling in. I felt like a big kid-imagine Thomas the Tank engine magnified as you run ahead of it! The movie captured the imagination 100%. Ant-Man exceeded my expectations.

282,Bill-166,"Ant-Man hits all the right notes. This is one of my favorite things about the MCU, they match the character to the genre. They're not trying to force them all into the same mold, which makes things more interesting when different characters come together. Iron Man - High tech action, Cap - WWII & Political Thriller Thor - High Fantasy, Guardians - Space Opera and now Ant-Man - Caper flick with an intimate family subplot.For readers of the Scott Lang incarnation of Ant-Man, Paul Rudd brings him to life perfectly. He's just extremely likable as a regular guy thrust into extraordinary circumstances. As Ant-Man the film explores the full range of his powers with a great deal of imagination. Michael Douglas' Hank Pym is pretty much what I'd expect an aged Hank to be like. The parallel father/daughter relationship stories are very touching. Michael Pena is just hilarious, and you can tell Edgar Wright wrote most of this.There are quite a few easter eggs for comic readers, and some hints of things to come. There are also some nice cameos and well drawn connections to the larger MCU.It runs just under two hours and has two post credit scenes, both of which are awesome.I saw it in IMAX 3D, and it was a very good conversion. The visual effects are just jaw dropping, including some genuinely fine work by the crew that did Chris Evans' pre-transformation look in Captain America:The First Avenger.I really, really enjoyed this and I'm already looking forward to my second viewing.",17 July 2015," Marvel does it again.

283,XweAponX,"""Ant Man"" has been one of my favorite Avengers, even in his other personae ""Giant Man"", ""Wasp"" and ""YellowJacket"". But this version of ""Ant-Man"" is not the same Ant-Man from the comics I read. That version was Dr. Henry Pym, who with his wife Janet van Dyne aka ""Wasp"" (Another version of Wasp), were part of the Avengers, maybe sometimes part of The Defenders, a short lived comic series that included members of The Avengers as well as Dr Strange. What is not told in any of The Avengers movies or even this movie, is that Hank Pym was the scientist who created Ultron- The films have Tony Stark doing it.This film is based on one of the side stories, where a burglar named Scott Lang steals Ant-Man's suit, but ends up using it to defeat a crook named Darren Cross. That's mainly the story told here. But Hank Pym is a large part of it, in this rendition his daughter ""Hope"" (Evangeline Lilly) partially taking the place of the character of Janet van Dyne.This film focuses more on the Scott Lang story, an ex crook who works with a couple of burglars and a computer hacker. He can't even keep a job at Baskin-Robbins, because ""Baskin-Robbin's always finds out"".So he is forced to take a job with his burglar roommates. But it turns out to be a set-up, set up by Dr Pym himself. So, all Lang finds is a cool looking Motorcycle Riding outfit. Fun things happen when he puts it on.Meanwhile, Darren Cross, Dr Pym's ex-protégé, responsible for Pym's loss of his company, has been trying to figure out the ""Pym Particle"" which is the basis of Ant-man's suit... Because he wants to sell it to some creepy looking guy. Pym knows that would be bad, so he wants to Sabotage that sale. But can he talk Lang into helping him, and will he be able to do it?One of the things from the comics that translated into the movie was Pym's Helmet, which he uses to talk to Ants and Bugs.Overall, I was pretty pleased with how this film came out- A lot of the things in it came straight from the comics, including the concept of what would happen if the suit-wearer went ""Subatomic"". But I mainly liked how this story takes the original Ant-Man and hands it off to the ""new guy"" (And his Daughter, but that's for a sequel). And once again, an i-Phone is used in a major gag - Watch for it.",13 November 2015," ""It's Not a Keychain!""

285,Anurag-Shetty,"Ant-Man tells the story of Scott Lang/Ant-Man(Paul Rudd). Scott is an ex-convict who has been freshly released from prison. Scott has a degree in electrical engineering but, due to some unavoidable circumstances, ended up becoming a skilled cat burglar. Enter Dr. Hank Pym(Michael Douglas). Pym gives Scott a chance to redeem himself by advising him to don a special suit, that enables the wearer to shrink to the size of an ant but, increase in strength & speed. Hank Pym tells Scott to embrace his inner hero & become the Ant-Man. Now, it is up to Scott with the help of Dr. Pym & his daughter, Hope van Dyne(Evangeline Lilly) to plan & pull off the perfect heist & save the world from the power hungry, Darren Cross/Yellowjacket(Corey Stoll) & his diabolical plans. Ant-Man is the most unique, hilarious, weird(in a good way) & self-deprecating superhero film ever made. It's fantastic(pun intended)! The special effects are surreal. The CGI ants look extremely lifelike. The 3D has been put to great use throughout the film. The sequences where Ant-Man shrinks down to the size of his namesake are a treat for the eyes & make for some super fun & exciting set pieces. The constant switching of camera angles between our point of view & how the world looks from the point of view of an ant is one of the highlights of the movie. You can't help but laugh at how insignificant the fisticuffs between Ant-Man & Yellowjacket look like from a human being's point of view especially in the climactic showdown which also involves the beloved, Thomas the Tank Engine toy train. That's the charm of this movie. The film doesn't shy away from just how ridiculous its premise is & takes digs at itself from time to time. Another refreshing aspect of Ant-Man is that it's not just a superhero movie but also, a heist movie. Scott Lang is the first superhero in cinematic history to have a daughter. Cassie Lang(Abby Ryder Fortson) is adorable. Scott's relationship with his daughter forms the emotional core of the film. I loved the fact that they saved Ant-Man's alter ego, Giant Man & Wasp for future films & concentrated solely on the origin story of the titular character. The scene involving Sam Wilson/Falcon(Anthony Mackie) is brilliant. Other than that scene, I was impressed that they kept the Avengers references to the minimum. However, producer Kevin Feige, director Peyton Reed & company make sure to keep reaffirming the viewer that this movie is very much a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As always, Marvel's casting choices are bang on target. Paul Rudd, who has mainly acted in comedy movies thus far, is spectacular as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Rudd is perfect as the slightly awkward, down on his luck cat burglar, whose life changes after he meets Hank Pym. Michael Douglas is amazing as Dr. Hank Pym. It's super cool to see an acting legend like Douglas, star in a Marvel movie. Evangeline Lilly is brilliant as Hope van Dyne. Lilly is the most feisty of all the Marvel women, including, Peggy Carter(Hayley Atwell), Pepper Potts & Jane Foster. Corey Stoll is excellent as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket. Bobby Cannavale is good as Paxton. Anthony Mackie is great as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Judy Greer is impressive as Maggie Lang. Abby Ryder Fortson is unbelievably adorable as Cassie Lang. Michael Pena is hysterical as Luis. David Dastmalchian & T.I. are effective as Kurt & Dave. Hayley Atwell, John Slattery & Martin Donovan are awesome as Peggy Carter, Howard Stark & Mitchell Carson respectively. Stick around till the very end of the credits for 2 incredibly important scenes. According to me, Ant-Man is on par with Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014) for the title of the best standalone Marvel movie ever made. An absolute must watch on the big screen, especially in 3D.",24 July 2015," The most unconventional superhero movie ever made.

286,ericwoodard84,"The best Marvel movie I have seen to date, and I love most of the Marvel collection. It has a certain je ne sais quoi, I don't know exactly what I loved so much about it other than to just sit back and marvel (pun intended) in it's majesty. This movie is an epic. A sleeper epic at that, I didn't expect much from it going in. Just like interstellar, the experience trumped all expectations and left me as beguiled in my theater seat as watching Jurassic Park for the first time in 93', yeah, it's that good.Paul Rudd is a favorite of mine so I am a little biased I suppose. His drab humor carries the show as far as comedy goes. Beyond the humor you had action sequences that managed to be both hilarious and riveting. I can't off the top of my head think of any other action sequences that were that indelibly hilarious and cute, while still putting me on the edge of my seat.

287,ivo-cobra8,"Ant-Man (2015) is my all time favorite MARVEL film it is my fourth favorite MARVEL film the first three are Captain America trilogy that I love to death while this movie stays right behind them. It is a fun and entertaining film and I have really enjoyed it, I don't have any problem with the film and I never really read the comic about Ant-Man, but watching this movie it is really solid super-hero movie. Ant-Man is MILES way better than Deadpool (2016) who get's so much praise for it! It is MILES way better than Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Wolverine, X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse and Hulk (2003) those movies really sucked. Ant-Man (2015) is better than those movies that is just my opinion you even have a solid cast. I love that Ant-Man doesn't kill people and when they blow up the building no one is hurt, that makes him a superhero. I am a big fan of Michael Douglas and he does an excellent job as Hank Pym he was excellent. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man was incredible. I mostly remember him from Friends when he played Mike, Phoebe's boyfriend and he make the movie with Jennifer Aniston also from Friends) The Object of My Affection (1998) he was terrific in Ant-Man. Evangeline Lilly from Lost and Real Steel is incredible excellent as Hope Pym who is Hank's daughter. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross / Yellowjacket was good at in his acting performance as the villain and last and at least Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon was wonderful to see him in this movie I loved it.Plot: Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world. I love the film because it has a heart and it has a redemption, everyone deserves a second chance. It also has a strong message bonding estrange father and daughter together. Scott Lang is a former systems engineer at VistaCorp and petty criminal who acquires a suit that allows him to shrink in size but increase in strength. The movie is an origin story of the petty crook Scott Lang who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good, and then look at someone like Paul Rudd, who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people's houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in. He becomes Ant-Man and he is doing the right things for his daughter. He's ex wife throws him out while her new boyfriend is a cop pursuing Lang, he has one chance to make this right to be in his daughter's life. REDEMPTION.I have enjoy the visuals effects and the CGI was pretty good creating Ant-Man I didn't mind it. Checked Ant Man out again very fun entertaining comic book movie that didn't use the alien invasion angle, falling buildings or the world is gonna end, just a simple story, great visual effects and likable characters. The Ant-Man/Falcon fight was bad ass and I loved how Ant-Man defeated him. He saved his daughter Cassie and he showed that he is a good father. In the comics he used pills instead of discs to enlarge and shrink things. I think that was a good change they made. A final battle scene in the daughters bedroom on her Thomas Tank engine train track, imaginative an original and fun. Marvel's latest may not be their greatest achievement but yet another gamble for a character that is less then popular in that Universe. Adding the legendary Michael Douglas to the cast was pure genius much as Robert Redford played along in The Winter Soldier. The overall movie is fun and the execution of performances are fine but Ant-Man doesn't quite have the punch that I was expecting nor rank in the top five of all the Marvel films thus far. However the character should have a few solo efforts in the pipeline not to mention he's be seen in Civil War and most likely the next two Avenger Infinity War movies.The rating I give to this film is 10/10 it is my favorite MARVEL film I own it on Blu-ray disc and I enjoy it watching it, it is a pretty damn solid good movie at least for me.

292,kieranbattams,"I have been following Ant Man since Edgar Wright was set to direct as i am a massive fan of his work. Then he left the project. I was worried Ant Man would just get lost in two different screenplays as i heard Wright's work was still being incorporated in, plus not knowing enough about the character from the comics.. But there really was no need to worry. The film turned out better than i could have hoped and even trumped my expectations. Paul Rudd does a great job and brings his all to the role of Scott Lang, a thief who has just come out of jail after three years. Over at Pym Tech Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) is developing a formula to mirror Hank Pym's (the original Ant Man) and to create a new breed of soldiers called the 'Yellowjacket'. Pym recruits Scott Lang as the new Ant Man to pull off a heist which will save the lives of millions.. and that is pretty much our movie. Michael Douglas plays Pym in this film and he really does it so well. Every time he was on screen he was a blast to watch and listen to and the father/daughter dynamic and storyline between him and Hope (Evangeline Lilly) without giving spoilers, was great to see. When Pym is training Scott to become the new Ant Man, that was so fun to watch and you can tell Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas had a great time working with each other. I was sort of worried at first that the shrinking and growing repeatedly during fight scenes would get on my nerves as at first it takes a while to adjust to (especially in 3d), but i actually liked that a lot and loved seeing the scenes where Scott was training with the ants when he is small.Speaking of the ants, they were brilliant. The way they are introduced by Pym seemed ridiculous to me at first but i loved watching them. Seeing Scott interact with them and fly around on them, it was so cool and something we haven't previously seen in any film. Marvel aren't very strong on villains and we have known this as it has been shown countless times. Villains like Abomination, Whiplash and Ronan have always felt weak and just as if they were made to serve as a plot device. I loved Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket though. I mean, he is sort of introduced as a villain to start with for not much of a reason but unlike most MCU villains he was expanded upon. When he actually put on the Yellowjacket suit, that was great and something that felt fresh, to see him as well as Ant Man duking it out whilst growing and shrinking and throwing objects that are three times their size. The climax featuring none other than Thomas the Tank Engine was one of my favourite fight scenes in the entire Marvel series. In fact, there is another fight featuring a well known Avenger that you probably know of, but just in case you don't i wont reveal what it is, but i loved that one as well.Michael Pena also gives a standout performance. These films feature a comic relief character a lot of the time, but if it works then don't fix it. Every time he was on screen i was laughing and i thought he did a very good job. Anyway,to wrap it up, i enjoyed Ant Man so much. I loved the scenes with Scott kicking a$$ as Ant Man, i loved Michael Douglas, Yellowjacket was awesome.. i don't really think i saw any flaws with this one. If Marvel continue to give their lesser known characters such good films then i am definitely on board the same way i was with Guardians of the Galaxy. Plus their are two post credits scenes which i loved. Really gets me excited to see not only Ant Man's future, but the future of the whole MCU. Another great film and i haven't given this rating since Age of Ultron, not because i'm a fanboy.... but because i know good entertainment and if a film entertains me as much as Ant Man does, it deserves this high of a rating.🐜",17 July 2015," Smaller scale but heroes.. and films, don't get any bigger!

Michael Douglas as Hank Pym though is what makes this movie even more amazing that it already is.He is so great on the role and it's so nice to see him actually act again.Even his backstory is truly interesting and I would love to see a prequel all about him. Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne is also very good.I like that she's a strong character and does not necessarily depend on others,I really like where they are going with her character and I'm super excited to see her back in the sequel.

There are a few story lines in this film,one of them being Scott and his daughter.I liked that story line despite most of the people saying that it felt forced and only put in the movie to make us care more about Scott Lang.I disagree actually because it absolutely did make us care but it also gave the character a reason to wear the Ant-Man suit and it truly worked. The villain in this movie (portrayed by Corey Stoll) is also a complain that I've heard quiet a lot.I disagree here also because in my opinion his intentions and motives from his back story are truly interesting and believable.I also truly liked Corey Stoll's performance and the yellowjacket suit looked glorious.He makes up for some really good looking and overall interesting fights with Ant-Man. The movie faced some problems along the production,it changed directors as it was once going to be directed by Edgar Wright but his concepts and basic story did not fit in with the MCU so they changed it and that is totally fine with me.I liked Peyton Reed's directing and style and I also like the humor in it,most of it being delivered by Michael Peña who every time he talks it's just comedy gold and I was laughing so much.

Yes, I favor it over the original Iron Man, but that doesn't make that movie any less valuable or bad.What I love about Ant-Man is that it's completely different from all the other Marvel movies and the amount of comedy that's in it tops Avengers Age of Ultron, which it also pokes fun at.

298,gianlucamarzano16,"Ant-man is directed by Peyton Reed and stars Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Corey Stoll, and Evangeline Lilly. It's about Scott Lang,(Paul Rudd)a skilled burglar who's given a second chance by Hank Pym(Michael Douglas)to get his life back together and be with his daughter. First off,Ant-man was originally supposed to be directed by Edgar Wright for a long time and than he's wasn't directing it. At that point the movie seemed to go downhill but than Peyton Reed got it and I'm glad to say the final product was amazing. The acting is fantastic by everyone. Paul Rudd played his role great, Michael Douglas was also great as always, and Michael Peña was very funny. It was great they didn't over use him. What made Ant-man amazing was the camera work when Ant-man shrieked down. Peyton Reed did an amazing job of showing how big everything is when your that small. The action was also fantastic, every action scene was shot so perfectly. There was surprising a lot humor and it worked great. Overall Ant-man was a fun superhero action movie with lots of humor, and it fits in with all the other marvel movies.

We've finally moved past the era in which directors default to the gritty superhero dark and gloomy BS. Comic book films have proved themselves as an inventive art form and one to be respected. Sure, we'll get a George Clooney Batman once in a while and dark one note crap like Man of Steel on the other spectrum but then we get great films like this one that embraces everything fun films have to offer. It even embraces the goofiness. That's a sign of not only good writing but confidence in your material and your actors.

300,rambofan4life,"Yes Captain America: Civil War is my number 1 favorite superhero MCU movie of all time I love, love this film to death. I love it so much It is a bad-ass action film I love everything from this film. I really enjoyed this film. This is Phase Three of MCU films and how many MARVEL films come out in Phase Three? I liked only two movies that come out Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming the rest movies in ""Phase Three"" that come out sucked. ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy MILES ways better than ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Chris Evens as Steve Rogers / Captain America is a bad-ass superhero my favorite MCU superhero off all time. I understand the character and what Steve had to do to defend an innocent person his best friend Bucky Barnes. I love Chris Evens performance I see a lot of his character been in a movie. The big epic battle begins and pits Two teams of MCU's Biggest superheroes in One Epic Confrontation. One lead by Captain America and his desire for the Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference. The other team following Iron Man's surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability. The same year that this movie come out the same year DC was filming Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice the same story two superhero's fighting each other and that movie was disgusting hell of a mess. This movie approved to be a good decent action sci-fi fantasy MCU movie my personal favorite. The basic plot of the story pulled from the comics pits Iron Man against Captain America, with the rest of the heroes in the Marvel universe forced to pick sides in an epic battle. That being so, the MCU hasn't always walked in lock-step with the comics, leading us to wonder what exactly the teams will be.Team Captain America: Hawkeye, Sharon Carter, Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Ant-Man, Scarlet WitchTeam Iron Man: War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, The Vision, Spider-Man.Chris Evens is still a bad-ass as the lead Steve Rogers/ Captain America in the film I love his performance. Robert Downey Jr. I love the men so much he is so charismatic so good playing his role as Tony Stark/ Iron Man. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow kicked ass in the beginning of the film and I love her so much in here she is great. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier is excellent he is a good/ bad guy and we see what he went trough after Zola found him. Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man is funny I absolutely love him, the best Spider-Man I ever saw. Andrew Garfield should have learn acting courses from Tom Holland. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man love the guy he is so funny I love him in this movie. I love when he become bigger in the movie. Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther I enjoy his performance he stopped Zemo he surrender him to CIA and he hide ""The Winter Soldier"" in his homeland. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon is fantastic he is great and supports Cap all the way he is his best buddy since (Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Don Cheadle is great as War Machine he supports Tony all they way and he leads Tony's team against Cap. I love Daniel Brühl as Helmut Zemo great villain bad guy I love his last name Zemo love it. Frank Grillo Rumlow / Crossbones I seriously love the guy so much the fight between him and Cap was excellent. Not only that I love these two teams fighting each other you have other villains in the movie: Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), Brock Rumlow / Crossbones (Frank Grillo from (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and of course Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) yes because he killed Tony Stark's Parents. The action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. I love the 1991 opening December 16th The Winter Soldier with guns killing Starks Parents I love 1991 report and that we find out there are still 5 super soldiers like Bucky Barnes. The cast Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl.Yes I would put this movie over ""The Dark Night Trilogy"". The Dark Knight is not the best superhero movie and gets so much praise. Captain America: Civil War is my number 1 favorite superhero MCU film it is based on a comic book the characters are based on a comic book. The fight scenes, the effect, CGI acting performance from everyone is solid. Great direction from the Russo brothers they know how the direct a perfect film off all time. I love the song on the end of credits Left Hand Free by Alt-J. I watch this movie three times in the row now the last time I watch it was in December 2017 I still remember because of the name Zemo. This movie is a solid perfect 10 because it takes the most vision of one of the most imaginative directors ever.",29 September 2018," The Big epic battle of two superhero teams - Captain America is the king my number 1 personal MCU superhero movie of all time

301,gangstah_vino,"Hi,  I saw civil war and I come with good news; it's AWESOME!  Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by  only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any tvspots after  the second trailer or whatever!  Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them.  Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were  black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing!  Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done  with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great  motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from  the other characters were great! 10/10  Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie  failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the  story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed  superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or  iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you  don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not  really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always  struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki & kingpin  in the series. 8/10   Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love  this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing  action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING.  You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will  bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete imax and has a  runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers  know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on  record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever.  20/10.   Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn  close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually  one of the few that are in there.   Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a  comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v  superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better.  Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the  characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now  after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes  are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well,  but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and  setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and  good instead of good and evil.   9 out of 10! Near Perfect movie for the fans(9.5) and a good solid  action film for the general movie go-ers(9)",12 April 2016," Now this is a good superhero movie!!

Superman should've been. Every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. In my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was Spider-Man and black panther. They got both of these characters right especially black panther. As much as I loved Batman V. Superman, I have to give this movie more credit. The Russo brothers did not disappoint and they delivered another marvel masterpiece just like the winter soldier. This movie was very good and I plan on seeing it again when it comes out to all theaters and maybe a couple more times!

I thought that marvel will never do a very good movie like it was winter soldier, but i was wrong, i was totally wrong I don't like to compare, but i enjoy this film more than batman v superman.

304,highmaster16,"Captain America Civil War is the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.",14 May 2016," Marvel are on a roll.

305,ivo-cobra8,"I don't understand the hate for this movie it actually surprised me, I really enjoyed this film. Captain America: Civil War is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy. To me the second movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the best one I just love that movie to death, but I like this one I love the first one but I just love all three of Captain America films. I thought the cast did a good job Chris Evens kicks ass once again he is Captain America and I look this movie from his point of view. He is really become my favorite hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers films especially Age of Ultron, Captain America is still a guy who has a lot of screen time that it is the focus of a movie and he is still the guy I can take a side I agree with him, I can understand his choices.We have also almost everyone from Avengers films except Thor and Hulk actors Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo did not appear. Chris Hemsworth thought that MCU fired him because he was not cast as Thor but he was later explained that MCU wants his own movie and his own stand alone path which I can't wait for Thor: Ragnarok.The cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl.In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions-one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. We have two opposite teams now fighting each other: Team Iron Man: War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, The Vision, Spider-Man.Team Captain America: Hawkeye, Sharon Carter, Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch.The battle between Captain America and Iron Man draws a political line in the sand. On one side, you have Tony Stark, a man looking to protect the world from super-powered individuals who've proved in the past to be more destructive than helpful. On the other, you have Steve Rogers championing civil liberties. It's the age old debate of safety coming at the cost of freedom, and we'll get to see it play out to a hopefully satisfying conclusion this year.The action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. I liked this movie more the story drew me in, the villain wasn't that good.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job, Paul Rudd he is fun in the flick, he has a great moment as Ant-Man he has a few moments but one predictable. Scarlett Johansson did great! Black Widow kicked ass specially in the beginning of the flick. Anthony Mackie I really like him as Falcon he as a lot of good stuff in this. He was down played in Age of Ultron but has a lot screen time in here which was excellent and they made that for that in this one I am glad for it. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. Falcon has a remote control like a mini Flacon I thought that was really cool. Chris Evens is to root for this character, Black Panther interesting the actor playing black panther was really good I like him and I am really interested seeing his up coming movie. Bucky Barnes: Winter Soldier did fine.A lot of people are complain about how terrible this movie is I am sorry I don't see it that way, I don't see at all it is peace of sh**. I wish that Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow / Crossbones wouldn't die and it was nice to see him in the beginning of the movie. I still wish he would work for the villain I still enjoy his screen time.I thought Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr, did work great as a opposite team. I love the end of fighting between Cap, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes. I thought the last fight scene was well choreographed I honestly think Iron Man would have won and he would killed Bucky Barnes. If Cap wouldn't have hurt his heart. I know when Tony find out Bucky killed his parents and he killed his mom in 1991 he decide to kill him. I mourn with Tony and it was a great dialogue ""That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!"" Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.I understand the hate, because Captain turn the law politics back to save his friend, but he actually try to safe an innocent man who was framed by Zemo. Captain America Civil War WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel and Deadpool I don't like those movies they are peace of sh** and too way overrated.

306,prospectus_capricornium,"Cynically speaking, the whole mold that the latest Marvel movie creates, is a colossal set up that engenders subsequent sequels and solo outings in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third for titular Captain America, ""Civil War"" is essentially the third Avengers film, starting with events happening a year after ""Age of Ultron"". That is not to say the film is mistakenly titled, because it still is, in all important aspects, a Captain America movie. It's just that, he isn't alone. The sheer size of this potential billion-dollar movie calls for an equally mammoth effort from sibling directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who also both helmed Cap's previous film, Winter Soldier. Their deft maneuver results in a beautifully crafted cinematic piece, whose towering bravura, bestows the entire proceedings with striking depth and sentimentality, which may not be the first for the genre, but enough to make it Marvel's best film, to date.In ""Civil War"", the brewing enmity between Steve Rogers/ Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) inevitably arises and turns bitter in the wake of their relentless campaigns to save humanity. The irony emerges amidst of their efforts, when greater authority finally asked who should be held accountable for the collateral damages brought both by their offensive and defensive operations. The motion begins to roll when a mission in Lagos resulted to unexpected amount of destruction and deaths.Differences in views divide the once solid group into two colliding factions. With Stark and his allies resigned to submit under the Sokovia Accords, Captain and the rest of his team, move away with staunch stand to operate freely under no greater force's jurisdiction. There is an intelligent attempt from both sides to meet halfway, but battle line is imminently drawn as a result of another attack which Cap's best buddy, Winter Soldier— now simply, Bucky Barnes— is believed to orchestrate. Doctrinal contrasts force heroes to pick sides, and the resulting chaos ensues a much bigger damage than what came in the missions they've previously pulled off together.While Joss Whedon's ""Age of Ultron"" is as massive as a superhero movie could be, Russo's Civil War is colossal in its own right, maintaining the former's size as it shifts to a more character- driven narrative, with its emotional weight heaviest on Steve Rogers' shoulders. There is a striking hint of effort to not overpopulate the proceedings with relentless chaos and destructions, but the ones inevitably allowed, are delivered in immaculate visual glory, each explosive action set- piece captured with breathtaking panoramic ingenuity. Even with all the intersecting plot lines laid out for every important character of this superhero extravaganza, they all eventually converge at one point, in which Captain Rogers and his connection with Stark, plays a key part. There is a visceral profoundness in how his character is written that finally places him at the center of his own film, and Evans has his commitment fully deployed for the role. And for a film whose own size seems to undermine its very own titular hero, the accomplished feat is truly massive for Captain, himself.A film of this size naturally gets devoured by its very own ambitions. Character-wise, Civil War is as big as the last two Avengers movies. And while Thor and Hulk are both missing in action here, newcomers are welcomed to fill in their shoes. The film facilitates the solid introduction of Chad Boswick's Black Panther, whose stand-alone film is due in 2018. But perhaps, as most people who've seen it, will say, the entry of the amazing web- slinger is the film's most anticipated highlight. Tom Holland's Spider- Man is a breath of fresh air, and it delivers some hope for the character's looming third big screen incarnation, next year. His comic timing may have been at par with that of Paul Rudd's Ant- Man, who shares one of the most genuine fanboy moments in the movie. This lightness comes amid the political tensions and philosophical differences between the opposing forces, one that is utterly missing in DC's Batman v Superman's messed-up attempt to pull off an essentially similar drama, last month.",27 April 2016," Best Marvel film, Yet.

307,blanketman77,"I pretty much like or love all the Marvel Studios movies, starting with Iron Man through last year's Ant-Man. So there was virtually no chance I wouldn't enjoy Civil War. But this might be my favorite Marvel movie yet. So many characters are in it, yet I felt like every one of them got at least one memorable moment, even lame ol' Hawkeye! At the end of Act 2, there's a 20-minute battle scene that involves a dozen super-heroes, and it's amazing, probably the best of this genre. I went in rooting 100% for Cap, but by the end, I was feeling really badly for Iron Man and kinda wanted to see him kick Steve Rogers' butt. We get a couple of new heroes – Spider-Man and the Black Panther – and they are both just about perfect translations from comic book to film. This Brit they have playing Peter Parker is probably my favorite Spidey yet, even though he's only on screen for maybe 15 minutes. He's exactly as Spidey should be: a nervous kid who handles his anxiety by being a nonstop motormouth during his battles. And the Panther is just so cool. Ant-Man plays a big part in that huge battle I mentioned, getting some of the best moments during the fight. But really, this movie is Cap's, Bucky's, and Tony's story. What helps make it so great is how Marvel has built up their saga over multiple movies – we're already familiar with and invested in these characters. And the filmmakers use that to great advantage here. It's sad to see them pitted against each other, but completely understandable in the context of the film. Bottom line: if you've enjoyed some or all of the Marvel movies, you'll have a great time with Civil War. It's a blast! And it might even draw a tear or two",15 April 2016," Another winner from Marvel!

308,AfterBuzz,"At the start, the film finds Captain America yet again adjusting to working under the increasingly morally ambiguous ways of the new Avengers structure. The set up is masterfully done. This is the fifth time we've seen the character and it's remarkable how complex and how much depth has been layered on to developing this icon. The Avengers film touched a bit with his feelings of what it was like to be in the modern era, and Winter Soldier drove the point home. Following that classic sequel, Civil War is a wonderful character study to go along with a purely thrilling plot. This was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver a film to advance the character of Captain America but also give Tony Stark a perfect finishing arc and more development himself. What makes BOTH Steve and Tony interesting aren't their abilities or weapons but the men themselves. Steve's moral code and ""man out of time"" elements are tested in this film but not in a way anyone saw coming. The viewer that normally would trust that Cap is doing what's right can look at his actions in a different light. He is still coming to terms with a past that is long gone and he is still longing for a better more decent era. Putting Bucky back in the mix clouds his judgment. Dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of any controlling organization after the events of the Winter Soldier movie has changed him. It's exactly like all the epic events and decisions Tony Stark has made over five films has changed the character of Iron Man. The resulting conflict between the two is as epic as can be. Like in Steve's last solo movie, his past comes back and explodes all throughout his new life. Tracking down his old pal Bucky, who was once an amoral assassin and a mind controlled Russian thug, proves to be a catalyst to everything that happens. Everything happens and unfolds in a believable and an intelligent manner. Every single ultimately cool character gets a chance to shine including Bucky but also incredible new characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man. Each one is fleshed out wonderfully for their supporting roles. Again, beyond cool. I really enjoyed both previous Captain America films but this movie is as dark and exciting as Winter Solder but also adds a degree of depth. This movie has a whole new flavor and that's exactly what was needed and what Marvel does so well. The 1940's romance and even the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" tone fit the first film quite nicely. The conspiracy thriller vibe of the second film was refreshing and so well done. Here, just like the Cap character, adaptation is a key. What they deliver with this Civil War feels fresh and is certainly amazing. Steve is still a patriot but he's continuing to question authority. His old-fashioned values pay off in many cases but here, are they leading him astray? Questioning what is wrong and questioning what is morally cloudy is a test of true character. Yet, being old school stubborn can result in missing key points and can result in bad consequences. That is exactly why the character of Steve Rogers is so interesting. He's so much more than a super soldier boy scout. There's depth, angst and pathos and we all can relate to him. He is out-of-place and he is old-fashioned but proud of that in a way. In a movie like this, pride comes before the fall. Tony Stark is ahead of him on that curve. Tony knows the price of arrogance and even the price of acting unilaterally with the best of intentions. He knows the road to hell is paved with those best of intentions. When these two philosophies and life lessons collide, that's as cool as the superhero brawl that accompanies it. The story itself is an amazing action thriller with a ton of intrigue and psychological issues. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this clever and this deep. I did expect it to be exciting and it certainly delivers on that. Each new character and each hold over Avenger character works in to the story perfectly. Everything about this movie is a joy to watch. The cast is perfect and everyone is used exceptionally well. This IS the best sequel the genre has ever seen and I know tat's saying a lot.

I loved both the previous two Captain America movies, and the two Avengers installments as well. Walking out of the theater, I got all I had wanted and more. Captain America: Civil War is now my favorite Marvel film to date. I loved everything about it, and was so happy to see just how amazingly well everything worked out.The Russo brothers did absolutely amazing with this movie. Not only are all of the characters flawlessly well rounded, but the direction and script are fantastic as well. The direction perfectly captured all of the action throughout the film, and was handled very nicely. Many wide shots were used, and the action was without shaky cam or quick cuts. All of the dialogue was near flawless as well. The audience is very subtly introduced to the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man, and dives deeper into it as the film progresses. The points presented by both sides are both right in there own ways, and that adds so much to this movie.The characters in Civil War are as close to perfect as it gets. I cared for every character in the film, whether they be a superhero or not. Black Panther's introduction into the Marvel Cinematic Universe was great, and I can't wait for his solo film in 2018. Spiderman in this film is, in my opinion, the best on screen Spiderman of all time. I like Tom Holland as the web head a bit better than Tobey Maguire, and way better than Andrew Garfield. His suit was great, and he delivered a lot of quips while fighting, just like the fans wanted. Lines such as ""You have the right to remain silent!"" or ""You have a metal arm? That's awesome, dude!"" made Spiderman near perfect in this movie. I loved the characters of both Spiderman and Black Panther.Besides the fact of the new characters, the Russo brothers also went deeper into the characters that we've already seen. Vision was given a lot more depth through Civil War, as was Scarlet Witch. The relationship between the two was great, and was given the attention it deserved. Both Hawkeye and Black Widow got a lot of screen time, and Hawkeye's relationship with Scarlet Witch, which he inspired to become an Avenger at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), was explored more deeply, and played off very well. Black Widow's internal conflict with which team she truly supported was shown neatly, however not distracting from the main plot.Both Iron Man and Captain America were fleshed out much more than they have been before, despite how long the two have been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Their struggles with each other was astounding at how well it was used. Falcon and War Machine were both given a lot more attention than they have been before, and that worked amazingly. As seen in the trailer, War Machine gets injured, and that gave his character a lot more depth. Falcon's friendship with Captain America was expressed more heavily, now that they know each other better. Cap's relationship with Bucky was also incredible. The exploration dealt to Bucky's character was high, and appreciated very much. And, without spoiling anything, Ant Man's character was, simply put, flawless all throughout Civil War.All of the acting was great as well. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Sebastian Stan, Chadwick Boseman, Jeremy Renner, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, William Hurt, and Daniel Bruhl all did fantastic. Each performance was unique in its own way, and all of the characters were played greatly. Each actor's portrayal of his or her character was amazing, and each and every character was given the depth they deserved.Overall, Captain America: Civil War is my favorite Marvel movie to date, and my second favorite comic book movie, topped only by The Dark Knight (2008). The Russo brothers have made a true masterpiece of a film, heightening all expectations for Avengers: Infinity War Parts I and II (2018-2019).",8 May 2016," My Personal Favorite Marvel Film To Date, Topping All Expectations

313,KingPandon,"OK, saw Civil War two times already here in Peru, the second time just yesterday April 30th with my 73 years-old father that really loves movies since he was young. He knows and loves everything Superman-related, and even so, he couldn't help but snore through BvS (almost the same with MoS back then). But oh boy! yesterday at the theater i saw my father laughing and even clapping like he was a 13 years old kid watching the ""serials"" he sometimes tell me about! It was that good!. On my first watch on April 27th (first screening), the theater was packed and the crowd reaction was the best i have seen since the first Avengers movie, but that was nothing compared with seeing my old man's reactions. I just wanted to share this because if any movie deserves to be ranked top just by the sheer joy it causes, is this one. An excellent movie, full of surprises (I have seen just the first trailer prior to watching the movie, and avoided spoilers like the plague). Acting-wise, the characters were spot-on, some of the best moments were the ones without any special effect, and the ones that used them were wisely edited. About the villain: a superb and realistic plan (within the boundaries of their universe). Only minor gripe was Martin Freeman overacting. Otherwise, the introduction of characters (new to the universe or to the Captain/Avengers films) was perfect, and rest assured, this is the best on-film version of the web-crawler yet! Recommended 100%, just go and see it spoiler free if you can.",1 May 2016," An absolutely spoiler-free comment

Now I just have to watch all the other marvel movies.I had absolutely no idea what was going on at some parts, but that was probably simply because I have barely seen any of the preceding movies. After seeing this I definitely will. To anyone else who thinks marvel is overrated, trust me, give this a shot. You will not be disappointed.

This is how you make movies let alone comic books movies.The story has been well thought out and and follows effectively. The characters and their motivations are well developed. Although a direct comparison between Batman V superman and this movie cannot be made, certain aspects can. For instance in BVS the new character introductions seemed rushed, however in CW the whole movie flowed really well. Age of Ultron was a bit of a let down it wasn't anything different from the previous Avengers movie. CW however was a definite step up the fight scenes themselves were astounding.

319,MrHomerJay,"This movie does everything right. All the things that BvS struggled with are handled beautifully here.The movie takes the time to develop all of the many characters in this series and introduce new characters. Two previously known additions to Avengers namely, Spiderman and Antman, and a brand new badass character, Black Panther, who proves once and for all that you can intro a new character without a damn origin story and have them play just fine.Every character gets screen time to develop an opinion on the issue that divides the ranks of the Avengers. Their conclusions feel natural to the character's experiences and therefore their motivations feel genuine. As such we are easily able to associate with characters on both sides. When the fights happen it's hard to know who to root for, you feel like you are watching your friends have a falling out. Even when you pick a side on the issue itself from your own perspective, you feel like the characters on the other side reached the ""wrong"" decision based on logic that makes sense to them.The characters on screen also act the same way. They love the avengers that oppose them, but they see no way out. They try to pull their punches, but eventually things escalate. This is brilliant, and makes you as the viewer much more invested in the fighting.The movie manages to get the pacing right also, the entire thing feels like it's 40 minutes long. When it was over I couldn't believe that all that time flew by.In conclusion this was an extremely enjoyable action movie. All the fights and effects are extremely well done and very exciting as we've come to expect from Marvell in recent years. But most importantly you care for the fights because the characters are likable and well developed, this lets you get invested in the universe and the conflict that it presents. Really well done.",6 May 2016," A really well put together movie, on par with quality we expect of Marvel

320,mahnanamuppet,"Just saw the movie this morning with my roommate. I have heard great things about this movie and I thought that I was going to cry given how the Avengers are dividing over the issue of government oversight. I haven't picked a team and I don't think I will. I'm a mix, I guess.Anyway, back to the movie. Wow. Woo-hoo! This movie is a wild ride of action, effects and story. I haven't read any of the comics, but I have been following most Marvel movies, and this one did not disappoint in the least. Even though the story is more mature and brooding, there is also plenty of humorous moments, especially in Tom Holland's Spiderman.People, those fans were not kidding. This Spiderman flat out steals every scene that he's in with his humor, agility, nerdy persona and Tom Holland is the perfect choice to harbor Marvel's youngest superhero. He even looks a little like Toby Maguire. He was undoubtedly the best part of the movie, even though he didn't get much screen time. Totally looking forward to the new Spiderman movie due next year.Another huge highlight is the jealousy between Bucky and Falcon. Maybe jealousy isn't the right word, but these two do not exactly get along. Their moments together, though brief in number, are awfully hilarious as well.Wondering what's going to happen in the next movies to come. This one really helps set the field for what Infinity War will possibly bring in the future. Check out this movie. It's quite a ride",7 May 2016," Amazing.

321,bartonj2410,"Back when Captain America: Civil War was announced during a Marvel Studios event in 2014, the anticipation I have had for this entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been rising with every single passing moment. Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, stood on a stage and announced the next Captain America film would be named Serpent Society and every single person was left a little underwhelmed. Then he backtracked and revealed the film's true title, as well as bringing out Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. to a deafening noise from the excited crowd.Taking elements from the popular Civil War comic and rearranging a few things to make it fit the continuity of the MCU, Marvel turned to the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, who did such a good job with The Winter Soldier, to bring this story to the big screen. The Russo brothers have struck gold once again with Civil War, a film that may not only be the best entry into the MCU but one of the greatest comic-book films ever made.After events in New York, Washington DC, Sokovia and finally, a botched mission in Lagos, the Avengers, led by Captain America (Chris Evans), are brought in by the US government to sign the Sokovia Accords, a document that states the Avengers must work under government supervision rather than their own free will. Many people still see them as heroes yet there is a growing number of people who see them as nothing more than vigilantes who should be put on a leash, or stopped altogether. Captain America, who also has the trouble of finding his best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) before he's taken out for good, decides against signing the document, causing a rift between not only himself and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), but splitting the Avengers right down the middle.While the Avengers, with the exception of Thor and Hulk, are all in Civil War, it is still most definitely a Captain America film, driven by a very personal story for the First Avenger. I have to applaud the writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, for the job they have done delivering a strong emotional core to Civil War. Captain America's main priority is getting Bucky, operating as the Winter Soldier for years, back at all costs and the effect it has on his friendship with Tony Stark is devastating, culminating in an emotionally fuelled finale that will leave you torn. These are characters we've spent eight years following so to see them come to blows, especially when you can agree with why both are fighting, makes you genuinely care about the fight itself and the fallout of it all. One of the highlights of The Winter Soldier was the action, particularly the hand-to-hand fights, and it's great to see the Russo brothers deliver brilliant action once again. The film is full of pulsating action whether it be close quarter combat or blistering chase sequences however, the stand-out action sequence in Civil War comes in the form of an all out brawl between two teams made up of various Avengers in a German airport. It's full of wonderful character moments and some brilliantly executed fun surprises, making it quite possibly one of the greatest scenes in any comic-book film. One of my worries for Civil War was whether there would be too many characters in one film. It could have been a recipe for disaster and ended in a convoluted mess but that is definitely not the case. The Russo brothers do the characters we are familiar with justice as well as introducing new faces that I can't wait to see again in the MCU. Both Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. have never been better in their respective roles of Captain America and Tony Stark. Downey Jr. in particular gives a really memorable performance as a guilt ridden Stark who feels the Avengers should be reined in. All of the other familiar faces are brought to life with good performances but the real stand-outs are the new characters that we'd all been dying to see in action. First up is Chadwick Boseman in the role of T'Challa/Black Panther, a prince and warrior of Wakanda. Boseman cuts a very regal and imposing figure as Black Panther, more than holding his own against the likes of Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Then there is Peter Parker/Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland. This is Spider-Man's debut in the MCU after Sony agreed to share the rights with Marvel Studios so they had to get it right. They didn't just get it right, they nailed it with Spider- Man. This is the Spider-Man I've wanted to see for some time now, quip after quip during the airport fight and a distinct awkwardness as Peter Parker, and I can't wait to see more of him in the future. I will wait to see how his solo film pans out but we could be seeing the best Spider- Man yet here. Take note DC, this is how you introduce new characters that will go on to shape the future of your cinematic universe.Juggling a film of this magnitude with the vast array of characters on show is no easy challenge, yet it's one that the Russo brothers thrive on. They have delivered a brilliant comic-book film in Captain America: Civil War and, with the stakes even higher and more characters to come for the next Avengers films, they are certainly the right men for the job.",30 April 2016," The Russo brothers deliver one of the great comic-book films to the MCU

322,Ramascreen,"CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is the best Marvel movie yet. It's superhero conflict done right! Spectacular action sequences, it's well thought out, it's got nicely placed humor here and there, the plot and the motivations make sense, all the characters have fair share amount of screen time, and may I just say that the new Spider-Man is totally awesome! Even if you didn't grow up reading comic books, you will geek out every step of the way. This film is every bit as fun as 2012's ""The Avengers."" One of the many brilliant things that Marvel's Kevin Feige and his creative team and writers and directors did is that they already mapped out Marvel Cinematic Universe, they already know what A through Z will be and how to connect the dots in between. And so when Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) shows the Avengers the disastrous consequences of their saving-the-world efforts, we the audience feel the impact as well because we remember those individual movies which lead up to this installment, they're still fresh in our memories. And in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, the repercussion of Cap vs. The Winter Soldier continues to be force that drives the story forward, because it's actually more layered than we think.I know what you're going to ask me. What do I think of the new Spider-Man? Fair enough. Before we get to that, let me just say that my initial concerns that this movie would end up just being some kind of Avengers 2.5 instead of a Cap movie, because of the inclusion of so many characters, my initial concerns subside because again, by this time, Marvel already knows what they're doing, they know how to balance fun and intense action, they know that they have to showcase the skills and traits of each character instead of applying one size fits all. Screenwriters Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely with directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are all master storytellers. OK.. so Spider-Man. He's alright. I'm kidding. He's awesome! And I truly mean that. Actor Tom Holland is perfect in this role. No offense to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but Holland's version is the Spidey that we the fans have been anticipating and I'm not talking just about his wise-cracking sarcasm, Holland owns it, he embodies it, he has some of the coolest lines in this film. And this whole idea of picking up the character from the middle and putting him into the mix, is absolutely brilliant because Spider-Man's time in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is as significant and as scene-stealing as Quicksilver was in ""X-Men: Days Of Future Past,"" he's the one most fans will talk about long after this movie's done.Another great addition is Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, and wait till you get a load of the surprise that Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) will have for you in the well-choreographed airport scene which is the part where both teams ultimately clash. That said, there is an underlying secret, there is a common enemy so smart that he doesn't even have to get his hands dirty, that's how clever this script is, because it's more than just about Sokovia accords or putting superheroes in check, and the reason the characters clash makes sense, it's more than just about a simple payback. That ability to keep itself fresh at every turn is one of the many, many strengths of CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR. The story ends with you wondering if your favorite heroes would ever join forces again when a greater threat like Thanos finally comes to town. What an outstanding film with great performances across the board. In this year where Daredevil is fighting Punisher on TV, Superman is fighting Batman on the big screen and apparently Charlize Theron's Ravenna is fighting Emily Blunt's Freya in ""The Huntsman: Winter's War,""... CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR trumps all.-- Rama's Screen --",13 April 2016," Outstanding! Marvel is unstoppable!

That is the question I asked myself while watching the movie. Civil War is a roller-coaster of emotions, because unlike the comic, which all the time favors the Captain America, in the film both sides are defended with various arguments, so much so that you get to have great sympathy for the team of Iron Man.The film is a drama, pure and solid, quite political, I dare to say that it is the movie of the Marvel universe more mature and serious that I have seen, in effect, follows this humor characteristic, but on this occasion it is not feel forced.The action is spectacular, the choreography of each battle is very well developed and the battle at the airport is epic, fun, Brilliant and amazing, accompanied by a good soundtrack. The CGI may be the least impressive of the film, because sometimes the characters looks like a 3D animated cartoon. but those scenes are minimal (thank god) Civil War is a masterpiece.

335,p-jonsson,"It is actually quite some time since I watched Doctor Strange but somehow the movie must have slipped between the cracks since I appear to have forgotten to review it. So I am about to remedy that now. To put it in simple terms: This is an excellent movie. It is a wonderful display of magical fireworks with a decent enough story to keep it together.I have to confess that I have not really read many of the comics containing Doctor Strange so it is a bit difficult for me to comment on the aspect of the film versus the comics. From the little that I have read I got the impression that the comic book version of Doctor Strange was a wee bit more dark, serious and mature. This movie starts from the beginning of his career though so I guess there is some justification for the less mature Doctor Strange in the movie.Doctor Strange is a skilled neurosurgeon but a bit of an asshole. Actually more than ""a bit"". He gets involved in a accident, that he pretty much causes himself due to his arrogance. Fast forward to the interesting chapter were we get to see Doctor Strange being, reluctantly, admitted into a scruffy looking monastery on the other side of the planet. That is when the fun starts. Doctor Strange is in for a ride. Slowly Doctor Strange gets knocked into him that magic exists and he is expected to practice it.The time at the monastery, or perhaps we should call it a school, leads to a few funny episodes and I do like the head monk's bantering with Strange and the way she does things. Talk about getting thrown into the deep end of the swimmingpool first. Strange's continued arrogance and immaturity is a bit annoying from time to time though. That has to be said.What is the use of super heroes if there are no bad guys around. So after Strange having trained for a while, and mostly failed miserably, the bad guys starts to crash the party. So no more pretty living room magic for Strange. It is time to go head to head with some serious competition. Unfortunately, for a good chunk of the first fights Strange mostly falls on his arse. They are still cool and beautiful to watch though.Slowly Strange starts to get to grip with this whole magic thing and he also starts to shed some of that arrogance of his and take some responsibility. About time since the despicable bad guy are, of course, working towards freeing the real BIG bad guy, father of all evil and mother of everything else bad you can think of. Time for a showdown.As the fighting escalates so does the user of special effects and personally I though the special effects were both beautiful and spectacular. I really liked them.I am not sure Cumberbatch would have been my first choice for Doctor Strange though. To me he do not really project the image of the wise and skilled Wizard I expected. He is not bad though. The only other person that stood out for me was the chief monk and The Ancient One which I also quite liked. The rest of the characters, well to me they mostly lived in the shadows of these two, even though they were in general likable and sometimes fun.There were a few rather hilarious parts where Strange has to reveal the truth about what he stepped in to his former girlfriend. I have a soft spot for the surprise moments in both movies and books.I rather not get started on time travel since I generally hate it as a story element since it almost always leads to paradoxes or is simply so poorly done that it is blatantly obvious that someone tried to cover up for a lazy and shoddy story. However I guess I have to mention that screwing around with time is an important part of the plot in this movie. Luckily it is done in such a way that it do not, in my opinion, negatively impact the movie. Actually, to my surprise, it is used in a rather cool way.So, bottom line, a movie I liked quite a lot. 5 out 5 stars kind worth of liking.",12 April 2017," Excellent magical fireworks display

336,ConfuzzledShannon,"A doctor, by the name of Stephen Strange, believes in the scientific and thinks himself a hotshot because of the intricate surgery he done, not to mention lives he's saved. After a car crash Stephen has to learn how live without some use of his hands, and his job. As he searches for a way to heal his hands he finds a place where magic and science meet. When this movie was first announced that Benedict Cumberbatch would be stepping into the role of Doctor Strange, I think everyone agreed he looked the part and we knew he could play the part. So the movie success relied writing and CGI. It blew me away. The acting was great, the characters were great, and CGI was top notch. It is even better than the comics in my opinion. Some of the characters are different gender than the comics and it works even better. I can not think of anything I did not like about this movie. Except maybe I wanted some of the characters to get more screen time. But even that is not that big deal because I also feel most characters had enough time on screen too. If I could find anything else I did not like it would really be nit picking so I am not going there.I eagerly await to see more Doctor Strange in the Marvel Universe.

337,brettdharris-14975,"I have just gotten back from seeing Doctor Strange {28th October, 2:24}, and, wow, was it intense. I'll definitely have to see it a second time to take in all the action and set pieces (not to mention Easter Eggs), but I can say, without a doubt, it is within my top 5 Marvel movies (the top five including Captain America Civil War, Captain America The Winter Soldier, The Avengers, Guardians Of The Galaxy, and Avengers Age Of Ultron; Doctor Strange is tied with The Winter Soldier).The effects are mind boggling, and the magic helps mask the whole ""fake looking"" problem that some movies suffer from. Yes, Benedict Cumberbatch's Stephen Strange is similar to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, but where they defer is really obvious: while Tony was humbled by his incident, Stephen becomes more arrogant and distant from everyone he knows. However, much like Iron Man, the story of Doctor Strange is that of finding oneself and becoming a better person because of it. The supporting cast are absolutely amazing, and Tilda Winton as the Ancient One was a choice I thought was odd and didn't suit the character. I was happily incorrect with my first assumption.The music is truly something that does work in favour for Doctor Strange unlike previous Marvel movies (while I enjoy other Marvel movie music, I can admit that they do pale in comparison to that of Star Wars or The Dark Knight). The story is one that has been told many times now, but Doctor Strange adds creative elements to it that make it stand out (such as magic; big shock, I know), and the final act of the movie is one that works in making Doctor Strange stand out from the standard Superhero movie.Doctor Strange is a strange movie indeed...and I can think of no other movie that would work better with such an uncanny nature to it.Doctor Strange is a Magnificent {10/10} movie.",27 October 2016," The Beginning of something Strange...but wonderful

339,samyoung-82648,"I'm not a fan of most of the MCU. I like intelligent dialog, believable characters and am not fond of the hyper violence that MCU is renowned for. You also have too much political correctness jammed down your throat, which is why characters such as Black Widow are so aggressive.Doctor Strange is none of those things particularly. The cast are all-round excellent. Tulsa Swinton was superb, mostly through solid acting and that she didn't feel the need to be hyper violent. It was such a refreshing change. Benedict Cumberbatch walked a fine line of arrogant and charming and was very believable. Chiwetel Ejiofor wasn't over the top and he didn't feel like the typical 'larger than life black character' (eg. Like the Falcon who is so clichéd, it's numbing).The story was also solid. No scene felt out of place or dragged. There were no twists or dues ex machina that stood out.All in all, ignore everything Scott Mendehlson said about this movie. I disagreed with almost everything he said. It wasn't over the top. It was extremely subtle for MCU. The characters were believable for a change.Great, great movie. Very thoughtfully executed by all. Definitely my favourite MCU picture. I thought the movie was suitable for 12+. Some of the violence is eye opening (eg. A beheading), but was handled off-screen. There is some blood and depiction of a damaged body.",27 October 2016," My favourite MCU film

The 'action movie' has come a long way - and this movie is one that will be remembered for a long time. Hopefully, Hollywood realizes that THIS is the way to make an action movie, and we see more of the same in the future.Take the best of Deadpool, the best of Guardians of the Galaxy, the best of Iron Man (and its spin offs), and add professional quality acting by many great actors, with some exceptional graphics (inception level), and an excellent script, and top that off with extremely good direction, casting, sound, editing and production - and you have the latest generation of action movie = Dr Strange. Never before in an action movie has there been such a depth of quality in all of those aspects and for it all to come together so brilliantly into the one modern action movie - unbelievable. In my opinion the direction of Scott Derrickson has come of age in one giant leap.Sure, there have been some very good 'one/two man' action movies in the past, but this one provides a complex platform for several great actors to perform their stuff at the same time - and they all deliver. Any movie with 'big' roles for Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tilda Swinton is going to be good, but this one adds Mads Mikkelsen as the 'villian', and Benedict Cumberbatch as the 'hero' - awesome !!!

341,roguecritic42,"This was for me the best of all the Marvel movies, and I am a huge marvel fan. They tied this movie in perfectly with the Marvel universe. The special effects were 10/10. I'm really glad they waited to make this movie when the technology of movie CGI was finally good enough to capture the true world of Dr Strange. The special effects at times reminded me of Inception, except this movie made total sense and was 10x better.The casting was done perfectly. I don't think I've ever watched a movie as visually stunning as this one. It reminded me of seeing Avatar for the first time in 3D. His powers and abilities and story line and character development were incredible. There are so many layers to this movie I look forward to rewatching it many more times over the years. I was a huge comic book fan as a kid, but never read Dr Strange.

It had a great cast who brought the chearecters from a comic book to a live action movie that is now a house hold name and will probably be one for a long time.Parents this movie is not like Deadpool that is R rated and super sexual it is PG-13 rated and it is very intense throughout the film.

Forget everything you know about Superhero movies, a beloved genre that began beautifully as an eccentric niche, and was falling dangerously close to convention. Let your mind be opened to the infinite impossibilities that await you...................Doctor Strange is a MASTERWORK worthy of the name, MARVEL!!! It is unprecedented in every mirrored and reflected facet, unparalleled in its incredulous abilities, there has NEVER been a film like it, it's breathtakingly innovative, truly groundbreaking, a kaleidoscope of unimagined vibrance, and mind-blowingly BEAUTIFUL!!!!! With a man at the heart of it all that is nothing less than pure MAGIC. I didn't watch a film last night, no, I EXPERIENCED a man transformed, body, mind, and soul into a superhero, and saw a star BURST into a powerful, blinding, supernova!!!! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you an unstoppable force, the INCREDIBLE, INCOMPARABLE, SENSATION Benedict Cumberbatch!!!! Mr. Cumberbatch doesn't just act, he BECOMES, giving life and laughter to a BRILLIANT Doctor at the top of his profession. His Stephen Strange is arrogant yet endearing, prickly yet charming, well-liked and jovial. He's got the world on a string and he knows it, and his steady hands have been magic from the beginning, garnering for him wealth, and acclaim, a career that he adores, prizes as if it were a real and breathing love interest. Stephen Strange feels so intricately nuanced and real, as exquisitely woven as the nerve cells he so expertly navigates. It's as if he's the other dimension, American Cumberbatch, like he's been living all this time in a parallel universe, just on the other side of the mirror, an ingenious doppelganger, who's as talented at neurosurgery, as Benedict is at acting. I believed him completely, as this rockstar doctor, dancing to 70's music, outshining his peers, laughing and quipping with the interns. I believed entirely that he could actually perform all of those complicated, impossible surgeries without batting an eye. Again, Ben doesn't ""play,"" Stephen Strange he creates him.Mr. Benedict Cumberbatch has exquisitely OUTDONE himself in this fast-paced, highly decadent, soaring epic of an origin story. It's so refreshingly new, so unique, unlike anything ever done before, a novel and masterfully executed, feat of cinema sorcery. It's a soaring magical kaleidoscope trip through the infinite and the impossible, a Technicolor, twirling dream through time. With his Doctor Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch has broken into a whole new untouched celestial realm of his vast and uncharted talent. I'm still a bit shell shocked...........The visual effects are in themselves MYSTIFYING, and spellbinding, cleverly tricking the eye again and again, until you're SURE what you are seeing, is in fact real!!!! Think of the first time you saw a magic trick, no matter how seemingly simple, as a child. Remember that astonished look on your face, that wonder and baffled merriment as you tried to figure it, but couldn't!!!! THAT'S what Doctor Strange is!!!!! Countless times I thought, with wide, incredulous eyes, ""HOW did they do that!?!?"" I've seen movies in IMAX before, but I was not at all prepared for these breathtaking, heart-racing, effects that I not only saw, but LIVED through, up close in this EXCEPTIONAL world!The supporting cast is excellent. Rachel McAdams is the gorgeous, natural beauty of Stephen's Ex, who keeps up with him, puts him in his place, and brings out something tender and gentle in him, as revealed in a beautiful, and loving inscription on the back of his watch. It's a moment that surprises and quietly delights, tugging at your heartstrings in the sweetest way. Benedict Wong's straight faced, dead pan reactions to Stephen's tom-foolery, and wittily relevant pop culture references, is BEYOND perfect, and there's this HILARIOUS scene of him listening to Beyonce that made the whole audience laugh SO hard!!!! It's a wonderful moment, and you really get invested into Stephen's side sojourn to make Wong laugh!!!! Tilda Swinton is a REVELATION!!!!! She's ethereal and mystic, and preternatural, as the Ancient One. Her voice sings with such old world wisdom, and again, her chemistry with BENEDICT is scintillating!!! Her tranquil strength, her enlightened power........... all prove her to be the ONLY choice as Stephen's Sagacious Sensei. All those naysayers who were wary of her casting will be FOREVER silenced after seeing her in action.Marvel and Benedict Cumberbatch have made magic and mysticism real before our very eyes. Ben becomes their greatest, and most multi-faced, three dimensional hero. What makes him so compelling as a superhero for me is his vulnerability. He's not a hulking, gamma-radiated specimen. He doesn't have laser eyes, an iron suit, or even super strength. He has the power of his mind, the magic coursing through his fingers, and the inner peace of enlightenment. He's the hero that MARVEL desperately needed, to bring new enchantment to their Universe, to take audiences to new worlds, and show them places they can't even imagine. This film is a labour of love and a testament to the mesmerizing caliber of everyone involved. For the Man with the Magic hands, this is the golden portal to everything he's worked so relentlessly for. This is his moment, his entrance to the beyond. A level of stardom that he has so rightly deserved since he first uttered those immortal words back at Baker Street. Like Strange himself, he's got time on his arm, and magic at his fingertips. I'm ready to take this adventure with you, Stephen, by astral forms, between dimensions, and through conjured portals.The beyond, the awaiting wonders and dangers beckon.

Stephen Strange is a brilliant doctor, who can perform the most complicated surgeries, effortlessly. Strange is also very arrogant & thinks no end of himself. One day, Doctor Strange meets with a fatal car accident. After he recovers, Strange goes on a journey to heal himself completely. This journey makes him meet people, who teach him about the mystic arts & the various different dimensions in the universe. Doctor Strange is a mind blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has made, yet another masterpiece. This movie is one of my all-time favorite origin stories, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are otherworldly. All the various dimensions shown in the film, look gorgeous. The scenes where Doctor Strange is traveling through various realms, look very surreal. You have to see the movie to appreciate the magnificence of these scenes. The 3D puts you right in the middle of this topsy-turvy, magical & amazing world. The highlights of the film are the New York set piece, the climax & of course, the performances. Benedict Cumberbatch is spectacular as Dr. Stephen Strange. Cumberbatch portrays all the different emotions his character goes through during the course of the movie, with aplomb. Chiwetel Ejiofor is outstanding as Mordo. Rachel McAdams is excellent as Christine Palmer. Benedict Wong is awesome as Wong. Mads Mikkelsen is brilliant as Kaecilius. Tilda Swinton is amazing as The Ancient One. Michael Stuhlbarg & Benjamin Bratt are great as Dr. Nicodemus West & Jonathan Pangborn, respectively. Stick around till the end of the credits because there's a mid-credits scene & a post-credits scene. Doctor Strange is another unforgettable film, in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe.

I have been collecting Dr. Strange comics since I was 7 years old, he is my all time favorite super hero, and I was filled with trepidation that they would ruin it; but far from it. Everything about it was phenomenal - the special effects, the costumes,the fight choreography, the acting... and it was very true to the original comics. Benedict Cumberbatch just nails the lead role and Tilda Swinton is amazing, as is Chiwetel Ejiofor and Mad Mikkelsen. The movie is thought provoking and inspiring as well as entertaining; I and my friends had an almost 2 hour conversation about, well, life the universe and everything after seeing it. You know it is a good movie when it evokes conversations of that kind.

I can't think of a way to make a more enjoyable movie than GOTG 2.From the beginning, the MARVEL STUDIOS logo has changed. While it's slowly creeping on screen, we used to see comic pages flipping. That's now replaced with movie footage, and the music is now epic, making the MS logo feel more classy and majestic.The opening credits scene is just so creative, and a scene like that could very well be one of the best ending scenes in another movie. But in GOTG 2, it's just the opening! Looking back on the entire film, I can't believe in this age where we're all so used to seeing flashy space and combat action scenes, everything gets better and better as this movie rolls along towards the ending.This is a really character-driven movie, and every single main actor gets fantastic screen time. No one is in the background. They all shine. Jokes are non-stop, and there are WAY more jokes in this sequel. Some of the humor is so unexpected and wacky that you'll just burst out loud laughing! You'll hear other people in the theater continue to laugh as the movie rolls on and you'll laugh again just thinking about what happened on screen.As funny as this movie gets, you'll be pleasantly blindsided with some extremely heartwarming scenes between characters. How can a movie make people laugh so hard, then the next minute have everyone sobbing, or at least fighting back tears? If you're the type of movie-goer who likes to brag that you didn't cry through an emotional scene, prepare to get tested. GOTG 2 has many emotional scenes, and they happen at the weirdest, most unexpected times. My bet is, you WILL cry at least once. There's just too many good scenes coming at you and you'll stumble. This movie is such a rare roller-coaster of emotional ups and downs. Enjoy the ride! The end credits are filled with things to keep you sitting in your chair. Don't make the mistake of walking out. There are something like 5 or 6 end scenes dispersed through the credits. You'll see people in the theater standing to leave, then sitting. Standing again, then sitting down. There's just so much going on in the end credits!From start to finish, this movie has everything and the kitchen sink thrown in.

Even if you miss out on the amount of plot, you will be easily distracted by the great humor. The jokes are well written through out the running time.

355,sjo-50785,"I adored the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Like many, I was blown away having gone in with no expectations, and laughed and grinned through the entire thing. It became my favourite film, on its own until Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece Arrival profoundly moved me, and so the stakes were high for the sequel that I arrived to with Baby Groot bobble-head in hand (bringing my cardboard cut-out was logistically impractical).When I went to the midnight screening (28th of April in the UK), I loved it. Everyone in the room did. From the very first scene where the rich visuals filled my eyes, to the following scene, which made, and continues to make, me grin from ear to ear and is my favourite scene in cinema. to the laughs and action and thoughtful moments that made up the rest of this film; they managed to take all that was great about the first and ramp it up.So yes, I exited the cinema at something past 2 in the morning, utterly delighted. I wanted to go again. And that I did. In the first five days of the film being open in the UK, I watched it four times (at three separate cinemas), and I have to say that I have been delighted with it every single time.Standout performances in this film must go to Drax, Rocket and Yondu—with the former taking the lead in laugh-out-loud moments in this film—while Kurt Russell has an absolute ball as Ego.One of the many, many things that I loved about this film (whose soundtrack, I would argue—having had it on hard rotation for this last week—surpasses the first's) is the fact that James Gunn's work is self- aware. We saw some of this in Deadpool, as Ryan Reynolds spent his time making fun of 'superhero landing's and similar superhero movie tropes, despite falling into a number of those, itself. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, we see a step up from this. Instead of making fun of the clichés that come along with this sort of film, they embrace them and ramp it up at times, having the duel effect of accepting that there are certain hoops that need to be jumped through while also retaining the sense of fun and ham for which the first was so lauded. Additionally, this also means that any sentimental message is passed on, while also you're aware that the tongue is rooted firmly in cheek: much akin to somebody who uses hyperbole to tell their partner that they physically radiate beauty- although the manner of delivery isn't meant to be taken seriously, the message is still genuine. Chris Pratt does this very well; I'm convinced he's not a very good dramatist, he's just such a charismatic and funny person that he gets away with it, which works perfectly well in situations like this, as he makes comments that plainly point towards motifs within the film which, in a Shawshank or a film of that ilk would seem out of place and stilted, but work brilliantly in the context. (Disclaimer: I haven't seen Passengers and so don't know whether his performance here proves wrong my theory about his acting chops)There are moments throughout the film that are surprisingly brutal for a Marvel film, definitely a high-end 12A, but not out of place, and there is a general joy that easily balances this out. If you go to see Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, you should absolutely love it. Admittedly, I went in with a lot vested in the film being good, but I have been to see it thrice more after that, and it still holds up for me. What I would say, as was the case with my brother, is that going a second time may help because this film is chocked full (both in the sense of the story-line and visually) and going multiple times allows you to notice little moments throughout—with there easter eggs galore for the Marvel fan, including references to the previous film. Also, I would recommend going to see it in 2D on your first showing: I went in 2D for my first two viewings, then IMAX 3D and then 2D again, and—although the 3D has some absolutely beautiful moments and really is striking—I found that it distracted from the film at times and I spent time looking at the film, rather than watching it. So yes, I could not recommend this film highly enough. James Gunn does a fantastic job of giving us a film that helps us learn more about these characters; care more about them; see them in battle and, most importantly, meet Baby Groot, who is a complete and utter delight. Bar one moment of slightly choppy editing (although this may just be my four viewings showing an over-analysis that most people won't notice) I could not fault it for the way it was put together, mixing light moments with dark brilliantly and keeping an excellent pace, and all of the cast are thoroughly watchable, with it a joy to be back in this gang's company.Now, if you don't mind me, I'm going to go and re-watch the original, before, potentially, going back to the cinema this weekend.

Of Course Star Lord makes what he can do best, leading the group of a**holes.The cinematography, the stable and funny story, the brilliant colors, that James Gunn added to this movie are just fabulous! The comedy is totally on point. Action scenes are great. The music? Well you can listen the GOTG Vol.2 songs over and over again and they all works perfectly in the context of the movie.Phase 3 of MCU is very strong first with Civil War, then Doctor Strange and now Guardians doesn't disappoint at all.

358,larrymeers,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the 15th in the Marvel Universe (i wonder how the studio hasn't ran out of ideas). This film focuses on the guardians and how they must fight off the gold people after stealing something of theirs, while Star Lord discovers his father and discovers the truth about him. That is one of the things i loved about this movie, so many things are going on and it is not distracting at all. It still manages to stay fresh and funny. The actors are still pretty good and some have improved over the last movie like Drax and Yondu. I also thought Ego(star lord's father) was a fantastic character. The dialogue is funny and very creative. As always the CGI is very good and the movie just looked beautiful. As far as action goes, i thought this was a great improvement.

I was so skeptical and really had a negative outlook. I am SO HAPPY that I chose to go. I was very nicely surprised.This is an incredible journey that shows the ties of friendships and families and good vs. evil. Very well written, directed and acted. Characters and story line were well developed. The movie was paced perfectly, nothing felt rushed and nothing felt like it was dragging, even with the movie being on the long side. The movie did not follow the always boring, somewhat predictable path. Riveting moments come at the least expected times. There are plenty of emotional scenes.This movie is wonderfully entertaining. The scenery is exceptional. I would have never imagined a Marvel movie to be beautiful, lighthearted, poignant, hysterically funny, intelligent, sad, happy and a just over all very satisfying. I laughed, I cried, I was drawn in and mesmerized. I left with a smile, feeling very satisfied - but wanting more. I really couldn't be happier.I actually had not seen the first GOTG. I was so entertained by this one that I had to go borrow that one from a friend to watch. I like them both a lot. Most of the time a sequel is not as good as the first.

364,skeletornumber70,"When I first saw Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, I had never heard of the team before and was only watching it because I was a Marvel fan. Ironically, 3 years later Guardians is about the only MCU series I even bother keeping up with any more(not that I don't like the others, I just kind of got burnt out after 15+ films all trying to tie in). I was nervous, because what made the first film so memorable to me was how much it's quality and humor surprised me, something which I was sure Vol. 2 would try and fail to recreate, as many sequels to surprise smash hits tend to do. However, director James Gunn has surprised me once again, taking the Guardians into new territory in a film filled with top notch action, impressive visuals, and gut splitting humor in a storyline that is refreshingly original.I was worried after seeing the trailers that this would ultimately be an attempt to catch lightning twice by basically repeating the first film with new jokes. But the trailers are pretty misleading(which is always a good thing with sequels) because the plot that they reveal is really only the first act of the film, including the spoiler character reveal at the end of the last trailer. This is where the viewers I think will be polarized, because after the fairly conventional first act Vol. 2 becomes a very different film than the original. I won't go into the villains, of which the film has multiple, because it's unclear who will be the main antagonist until the plot reveals it, bringing the film's multiple threads together.Although the plot was well written, what truly makes this movie work, much like the first, is the characters. In true sequel fashion, we see the core group split up for a large portion of the film, but the side characters are so well written that it is just as enjoyable to see our team interact with them as it is when they interact with each other. It also allows each character to expand their arc rather than just playing their respective parts on the team. The humor is excellent throughout, and it seems to have gotten even more adult oriented this time around, with many hilarious, not so subtle sexual innuendos making the audience laugh out loud. All in all, if you enjoyed the first film then I cannot see how the second part could be any less entertaining to you. With top notch humor, an engaging story, and beautiful special effects, Guardians 2 provides a great escape to a pop culture savvy corner of the Galaxy that we all wish to visit again and again.P.S. if you enjoyed Michael Rooker's hilarious redneck space pirate Yondu the first time around, I'll go as far as saying he's the MVP in this installment.",5 May 2017," Awesome Mix, Volume 2

Between Yondu, his surrogate father, and Ego, his real father, he's got his share of problems. The rest of his team have family issues as well, and director James Gunn manages to work on each of them. In the process, he deftly sidesteps the issues that have plagued previous MCU sequels, while also reminding us of the menace that is Thanos which lurks just off-screen despite not launching the plot of this film into a larger tie-in with the rest of the MCU.The movie is fun, funny, and whenever Baby Groot is around, simply adorable.

377,kutluyal,"""Fun"" isn't a dirty word. It's also not a word that means ""not art"" or ""lacking drama."" And the word ""funny"" likewise doesn't negate artistic integrity or drama. Anyone who thinks these words are contrary to great filmmaking or ""true art"" simply doesn't know what they're talking about, and should probably stop trying to discuss cinema. Humor, comedy, and satire not only have a long and glorious history in art and expression, they are in fact very hard to do correctly. Writing comedy and directing comedy is every bit as difficult, if not more so, than straightforward drama in many ways. And to whatever extent fun and comedy in films can also serve to purely entertain sometimes and to add levity to situations, that's not bad nor limiting of art either.It speaks to the absurdity of modern film debate and fandom that I even need to point out such glaringly obvious, fundamental truths about storytelling, movies, and art. But such is the nature of rabid, narrow personal preference driven by bizarre loyalty to one publishing corporation over another. Fandom is always -- generally speaking -- turning everything into ""us versus them,"" but the extent to which it's devolved into outrageously uninformed and limited claims of what is or isn't ""art,"" is a newer development and a sign of the shallowness of so much of our modern discussion of cinema when it comes to genre storytelling.Thor: Ragnarok is fun, and it's also funny. It is also dramatic, it is also terrific art, it is also the best Thor movie by a wide margin, and it is one of the best Marvel sequels released so far.If those statements or words bug you, then get over it and grow up",20 October 2017," great experience

378,joshbarton15,"Both missing in action since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor and Hulk could be seen as the forgotten children of the MCU, and when they're two of the most popular characters with fans, that seems quite criminal to me. The two haven't really been done justice in their solo films yet, even though I'm a big fan of Thor, but with Taika Waititi on board to direct Thor: Ragnarok, my expectations were sky high.Imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is pitted against the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), a former ally, in a gladiatorial duel to determine whether he can travel back to Asgard and put a stop to Hela (Cate Blanchett) and her apocalyptic tendencies toward Asgardian civilisation.It's testament to Marvel Studios that, even with Thor: Ragnarok being the seventeenth film of the MCU, they can still produce work as unique and exhilarating as they have here. Taika Waititi has worked wonders to inject the Thor solo films with such vibrancy of colours and characters, leading to Thor: Ragnarok becoming one of my favourite entries into the MCU so far.With Waititi involved, I was expecting this film to be funny however, I was nowhere near prepared for just how funny it ended up being. Seriously guys, there are plenty of moments that caused raucous laughter from the audience, Thor and Hulk giving the Guardians of the Galaxy a run for their money as the funniest MCU heroes. It's the screenplay from Eric Pearson that should take most of the credit, along with some of the brilliant new characters we're introduced to, Korg in particular played by Waititi himself being one of the MCU's most welcome additions.The action, of which there is plenty, is driven by the retro vibes of Mark Mothersbaugh's score and even Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song, which kicks the finale into overdrive particularly well. Javier Aguirresarobe's cinematography combines seamlessly with the expectedly stunning visual effects to create an almost psychedelic sense to the action sequences.Coming to the performances, Thor: Ragnarok features a strong ensemble cast, pretty much all of them showing some fine comedy instincts at one point in the film. Chris Hemsworth leads the film with such a confident performance, matching both the cockiness and naivety of his character to great effect. Much like people say Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, I just can't imagine anyone else playing Thor.The supporting performances make this such a special film, Mark Ruffalo doing some great work as the Hulk/Bruce Banner, keeping his place as one of the best actors within the MCU. Tom Hiddleston returns to the role of Loki and he's expectedly wicked, making it easy to see why he's such a favourite with the fans, while MCU newcomer Tessa Thompson shows plenty of potential to become a future fan favourite with a performance full of grit and fire as Valkyrie. If you're a fan of Jeff Goldblum then I'd just like to say you won't be disappointed with his performance as Grandmaster, a character just as eccentric as Goldblum himself.I really liked Cate Blanchett as Hela, the villainess of the piece. While she may succumb to the weak villain syndrome that plagues superhero films these days, I felt that she suited the tone they were aiming for with Thor: Ragnarok. If the heroes can have some fun, why can't the villains have some as well?Thor: Ragnarok finally gives Thor the solo film he deserves as one of the original Avengers, full of laughs and plenty of heart, the road to Avengers: Infinity War is nearly complete. I, for one, cannot wait.",25 October 2017," An utter blast

The CGI,fight scenes,epic battles,monsters etc..kinda remind me LOTR.Also,when I ve read the first reviews of this,some critics were praising the soundtracks too.Wow..they were completely right this movie's soundtrack list is on the same level with GotG 1 which was perfect.They finally gave hulk a personality.Even though he looks all big,formidable and scary,he was kinda adorable every time he talks:).So glad they finally made him talk.They really improved his CGI.The best version of Hulk in MCU.The haircut made him better too.Tessa Thompson surprised me with her performance.I still hear some people complaining about the color of her skin.Cause she doesn't look like Valkyrie in myth.Well,she doesn't have to actually.All I care about is,her performance.And she did really good.So put another major hit on MCU.They did it again.We have another MCU movie approved by critics and audiences.They have successful track record since 2008.Unlike some people's petty,shallow claims,I don't think marvel is always using the same formula again and again since 2008.Cause if they fallowed that path since 2008,people wouldn't watch their movies for the past 9 years.And they definitely couldn't create the highest-grossing franchise of the planet without their major players like Fantastic 4,X-men and Spider man.",20 October 2017," RagnaROCK!!!

He does some pretty epic sh*t in this movie and he is definitely not under-powered anymore. Thor in unleashed in this, I love that.2) Marvel did a damn good job in hiding some spoilers in the trailers.3) design-wise, the movie is totally beautiful. not a single bad effect in the movie. even the scene that changed from city to field looks better on the actual big screen.4) the freaking soundtrack. absolutely perfect. Immigrant Song FTW.5) Hela is totally bad-ass too. powerful, commanding, with just the right amount of scenery-chewing. hell, a lot of characters are so delightfully over-the-top in this.6) great supporting cast too. Valkyrie owns everything the moment she enters the movie. even Surtur was pretty darn hardcore. and Korg is freaking hysterical. Man I loved Korg!7) the movie's got a lot of humor. that may be a problem to some..but, when it's time to take things seriously, the movie does exactly that. specially towards the spectacular third act, when real sh*t is going down, the humor dials back a ton. It is only during the Sakaar portions of the movie where most of the humour is, not without several moments of sincere character interaction of course.8) I thought what they did with the ""Ragnarok"" part was kind of genius. this may not be the Winter Soldier of Phase 3 they told us, but it does make some significant changes to the overall MCU, or at least, the Thor section of the MCU.9) The pacing of the movie was perfect. Plus there wasn't a single scene in which I felt bored.Overall this was one of Marvel's best films for me.

385,TheLittleSongbird,"Really enjoyed the first 'Thor' and loved even more its bigger, darker and bolder follow-up 'Thor: The Dark World'. 'Thor: Ragnarok' manages to be the best of the three, and is not just a strong contender for the funniest Marvel Cinematic Universe film (yes even more so than the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films) but also one of their best to date.As said in my review for 'The Death of Stalin', 2017 has been very hit and miss for films, the best ones being wonderful (I.e. 'God's Own Country', 'The Farthest', 'The Death of Stalin', 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Wind River', 'IT', 'The LEGO Batman Movie') and the worst ones being dreadful (i.e. 'Baywatch', 'The Snowman', 'The Emoji Movie', 'Stratton', 'Flatliners', 'The Mummy', 'Transformers: The Last Knight'). 'Thor: Ragnarok' is to me up there with the year's best. Would even go as far to say that it's one of the best and most entertaining ""superhero"" films so far, whether in Marvel, DCU or anywhere.On a visual level, 'Thor: Ragnarok' is the best-looking of the three 'Thor' films and of Marvel in general. Asgard looks colourful and atmospheric. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations are stunningly vivid. The special effects and stunts are not just dazzling and have substance and purpose rather than just being thrown in for the sake of it, they are among the best of any Marvel film. Just for the record, Marvel get a lot of hate, particularly in the ridiculous and blown completely out of proportion DCU vs Marvel war, have personally enjoyed a lot many of their efforts. The music pulsates thrillingly and is also catchy and rich in atmosphere and emotion.'Thor: Ragnarok', as said, is a contender for Marvel's funniest film. The dialogue crackles in wit and deadpan deliciousness, and absolutely loved Thor's quips and the clever in-jokes (Loki's horrified reaction at coming face to face with Hulk was a standout). They are all placed adeptly, placement is never questionable.It's not just about the humour that makes 'Thor: Ragnarok' so great though. Like 'Thor: The Dark World' in particular of the previous two films, the action is absolutely thrilling and breath-taking in spectacle (almost 'The Lord of the Rings'-like in scale). There is plenty of bold dark-natured tension and the emotional moments give the film a lot of heart and are genuinely moving.Taika Waititi balances humour, action and drama with ease and it shows in the compelling and tightly structured and paced story. The characters are even more expansive in development, both intrigue and entertain and their well fleshed out personalities make them easy to care for them. Thor and Loki are beautifully realised characters while Hulk is the most interesting he's been in a long time. Hela is not just the best non-Loki 'Thor' villain (so much better than the one-dimensional and underwritten villain of 'The Dark World) but also one of the best villains in the Marvel canon, not just posing a threat, interesting in personality and having a motivation that nobody will scoff at but she is also one of few Marvel villains to actually have an arc. Korg (with Waititi writing himself in to portray) is a bit random but is a lot of fun.Chris Hemsworth is at his most relaxed and charismatic, while Tom Hiddleston is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. Anthony Hopkins continues to bring welcome gravitas to Odin and doesn't ham up. Cate Blanchett relishes the character of Hela, and makes her a character that's menacing, entertaining and oddly rootable.Mark Ruffalo is a strong presence as Hulk, Benedict Cumberbatch brings everything that was good about his Dr Strange in the first place and Jeff Goldblum is suitably playful. Karl Urban comes off least but does his best with the relatively little he has (which to me was nowhere near distracting enough to bring the film down).Overall, a brilliant film with Thor and Marvel being at the top of their game. 10/10 Bethany Cox",22 October 2017," Thor and Marvel Cinematic Universe are at the top of their game

This time it was not the case. Marvel universe movies have been my favorites from the very beginning of the story and Thor:Ragnarok as the latest edition has surpassed my expectations. I was hoping for a another good entry in the Marvel universe but this was on another level entirely. This movie is fun, funny, full of action, well acted, fits the story perfectly and what is most important it feels fresh and original. It is different from the other Thor and Marvel movies and stands firmly on its own while still being a bridge to the culmination of the Marvel universe. It's light tone is in my opinion a good set up for the final chapters of the Marvel universe which are no doubt going to be much darker and more dramatic.

392,j_forbesy,"Thor: Ragnarok is coming out at a time where people are starting to ask if we have reached comic book fatigue. To that, Thor: Ragnarok puts a big cross through that thought. Thor changes the game. We can't get tired of a sub-genre when the films keep reinventing themselves every time.Ragnarok is a blast start to finish. If you are someone who liked laughing, then you will have a smile from start to finish. Every bit of humour hits and if you are an Australian like me, you will get a kick out of a few jokes.If Ragnarok was a chain, there would not be a weak link. While some links are weaker than others, there is no outright weak part of the film. Everything was at the minimum, just solid. Every character felt like like they were used close to their potential. Every actor and actress put in the performance they needed. You felt like 99% of characters were done perfectly. The only slight complaint that can be had about characters in this film was the villain of Hella.Like most Marvel villains, she is terrifically performed by Kate Blanchett and she is a force when she needs to be, but by the time Black Panther comes around next year, she will be quite forgettable. What they did do well with her however was use her to set up some terrific Thor history.As mentioned, the humour was outstanding, and I think that comes down to Taika Waititi. While he didn't get a writing credit on the film, you know by the style of the humour that he had a lot of input into what was happening on screen.While still on Taika, his directing was fantastic. There are some shots in this film that I want as a wallpaper because they are look like they should be paintings. The action was shot really well, the emotional moments had an intimate to them and of course the wide shots of the landscapes were brilliant.Something I really noticed this is the use of the music. They really tapped into the Guardians music style and it worked so well with what was happening on screen. They had a nice balance of using songs when needed but working in score when it is much needed.Ragnorok is a film that if you are going to have a problem with something, chances are it is going to be something personal. For me, what stood out as a negative was the pacing, however that comes of the back of a massive positive. This film is trying to balance two stories that could have easily been a film separately, and does a really good job of it, however I felt as though the Ragnorok story line did feel a bit short changed at the end. They weave the two stories well but at the end of the day, Thor can only be present in one story at a time.Overall, Thor: Ragnorok is a blast from start to finish. It captured the humour and light hearted fun that the first Guardians had and took it to a level you wouldn't of been able to think of. Taika Waititi was by far the stand out of the film both infront and behind the camera, and it couldn't have been achieved without him. As mention, if the film was a chain, the weakest link would still be over 90% strong.9.5/10",26 October 2017," Thor: Ragnarok Review

397,pramsalim,"Let me get this out of my system, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the most fun I had at the movies in 2017. It's one of those movies that had everything. Action? Check. Comedy? Check. Amazing VFX? Check. Hulk being a God-smashing maniac? Double-check. This is definitely the best out of the Thor series. The two previous ones were just generic superhero movies. They weren't bad, they were pretty good. But as soon as you left the theater, you won't be thinking about it anymore.This one, however, wasn't generic. It was different. We were used to seeing Thor as this almighty God with a hammer that nobody can lift. And that's pretty much it. To be honest, I never cared much about Thor. He just wasn't that interesting. But this movie drew sort of a parody of his image and it was really fun to watch. And let's not forget about the Hulk. He is so lovable in this movie. How do you even make a person want to cuddle a 10-foot green abomination? You got to be a genius or some kind. Marvel appointed Taika Waititi to direct this movie. An indie darling from New Zealand that made comedy hits like What We Do in the Shadows, Eagle vs. Shark, and most recently, The Hunt for the Wilderpeople. They all have this unique dry humor that I adore very much. And he brought his signature style again for this movie. I respect this move by Marvel because a lot of studios are afraid of trying new things. A lot of directors were left with minimal creative decisions when it comes to big blockbusters. One of the case was the Fantastic Four reboot by Fox, two years ago. Josh Trank was so frustrated at Fox's dominating involvement in his project that he eventually took his frustration to the social media. Marvel don't want this to happen. They bravely take the risk of giving directors creative decisions. Though sometimes it could result to a mixed bag like Iron Man 3, it could also be a smashing hit like Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok.In the end, this movie is a total blast from start to end. It may be different than the other Marvel movies, but I swear there is nothing to regret. Whatever this movie lacks in dramatic aspects, it makes up in its comedy and fun characters along the way. And by today, I know that Thor isn't on my Top 2 Most Boring Avenger list anymore. Though Hawkeye is definitely still there.

Not so!By bringing in Taika Waititi, a New Zealand director who brings in his special vision and kiwi humour into the mix, this an amazing, kaleidoscopic, gut-bustlingly hilarious ride. Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster is wonderfully funny, Tessa Thompson as Valkerie, a hard-drinking Asgardian warrior is a total breath of fresh air and Korg (played by the director) is just as eccentrically wicked as Rocket Racoon. The Age of Ultron got criticized by some for including a bar scene where the Avengers have fun with Thor's hammer. But to be honest, I'd always welcome the Avengers having a good old time, making jokes, bantering and insulting each other in the process.Doctor Strange makes an appearance, which is amazing.

400,the_remixer08,"First of all, I'm glad that great ratings are continuing to climb on this film despite the phony low reviews that have been given here. My experience after watching it twice and also planning watching a third time, believe the hype.Ryan Coogler does an excellent job and the actors are incredible. He knows who his strong actors are and they deliver 110%. He made Michael B. Jordan's role as Killmonger so complex that you didn't know whether to dislike him or be on his side despite how menacing he was. I cannot wait to see him in Creed 2 so I can be reminded it that he really is a good person lol!This movie doesn't really show heavy action for Black Panther (you get that intro in Civil War) but it introduces you more to how he operates as the new king, and the choices he will have to make. However, leaves you satisfied just the same.Ludwig Gorranson who does an excellent job with the music score, is no stranger when it comes to working with Ryan, as he has worked with him in Fruitvale Station and Creed. The music score is a character within itself, as they literally speak for Black Panther/T'Challa and Killmonger during their quiet moments. The research and tours with these excellent musicians during his visits to so many countries in Africa really showed, and I understand why Coogler likes working with him.I do hope people do not fall for these bad reviews which are obviously there to try to scare people away. My parents are not even into comics and they enjoyed every second. For a lengthy movie, it didn't even feel like you were there that long. Go see the movie for yourselves.

402,shawneofthedead,"Superhero movies never get a fair shake. There's always been an invisible - but undeniable - whiff of critical disdain attached to films revolving around people with superhuman abilities. More often than not, these films are viewed (and assessed) as popcorn entertainment: good fun, but not objectively good. Even the best examples of the genre are rarely, if ever, taken seriously by critics or award shows. But all that is set to change with Black Panther - a bold, brilliant blockbuster teeming with ideas, characters and messages that will make your soul take flight. For once, it's no exaggeration to say that you've never seen or experienced anything like this before.The film gets off to a somewhat sedate start, as we're re-introduced to T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the freshly crowned King of Wakanda who is also infused with the ancestral powers of his nation's panther god. Writer-director Ryan Coogler takes his time in introducing us to all the key players in the film's first act, from the most important members of T'Challa's royal court to the rites, rituals and rigidity of Wakanda itself.It's never boring, but Black Panther does linger in a minor key for a while. You might find yourself wondering just where the film is going, as T'Challa deals with a challenge to his authority from within Wakanda's five tribes. It can be hard to imagine, too, just what the film wants to say when T'Challa - who could easily delegate the responsibility - takes it upon himself to personally hunt down dastardly arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to retrieve a stolen artifact made of Wakanda's most precious natural resource, vibranium.But put your trust in Coogler - he's certainly earned it with his masterful blending of tension, character and story in his previous two films, Fruitvale Station and Creed. As Black Panther unfolds, everything starts to make a whole lot of sense, in dramatic, emotional and narrative terms. Suddenly, we're not just witnessing the growing pains of a new king. As it turns out, Black Panther is, for its titular character, an existential odyssey: as he fights for his nation's survival, T'Challa must also grapple with the choices (and sins) of his ancestors, deciding whether to embrace or reject them.Most significantly, Black Panther uses its blockbuster platform to examine complex issues such as racism and colonialism in thoughtful, intimate ways. The fiction of Wakanda - a hyper-evolved African nation that has kept its technological advances a secret from the rest of the world for centuries - allows Coogler to hold up a mirror to the facts of the world in which we live. In quite unprecedented fashion, we are presented with a host of proud, brave, indomitable African warriors who have lived their lives free of the horrors of slavery and institutionalised racism. Just as Wonder Woman gave little girls the world over a hero in their own image, Black Panther will do the same for generations of black children who have never before seen themselves represented on screen.If that sounds impossibly weighty and grim, don't worry. Coogler's script, co-written with Joe Robert Cole, is far from preachy. There may be a hint or two of hand-wringing melodrama to T'Challa's central dilemma - should Wakanda venture out into the world and lead by example? - but it's cleverly off-set by the depths of darkness and despair written into T'Challa's nemesis: Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan). Shaped by the very different circumstances of their lives, one man turns towards the light, and the other away from it - and yet, neither man falls simply into the black-and-white categories of 'hero' or 'villain'. Somehow, Coogler shades centuries of history and hope into the conflict at the heart of their troubled relationship.Black Panther is no slouch, either, when it comes to turning up the heat in terms of action and spectacle. There's a jaw-dropping car chase through the neon-washed streets of Busan that's easily one of the most exhilarating scenes you'll see all year. Fight scenes are pulled off with remarkable flair, particularly when it comes to the swift military precision of the Dora Milaje - an incredibly cool, all-female special forces unit devoted to the protection of Wakanda's monarch. Wakanda itself is an eye-popping fantasy scape: a heady blend of futuristic elements and African traditons, colours and music.Leading the film's top-notch ensemble, Boseman is the film's quiet backbone: an invaluable presence and the reason everything holds together at all. He shares an electric chemistry with Jordan, who blends swagger, menace and pathos in creating the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most complex, nuanced and sympathetic antagonist to date. Fantastic as the two leading men, however, they're not the breakout stars of the film. That honour belongs to a trio of female characters - each one given depth, layers and a fierce, real on-screen presence that's still rare enough that they shouldn't be taken for granted. Lupita Nyong'o injects strength and steel into her portrayal of Nakia - a former and future love interest for T'Challa who manages to be interesting in her own right. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira is a force to be reckoned with as Okoye, the righteous leader of the Dora Milaje; while Letitia Wright's Shuri - T'Challla's younger sister who also happens to be Wakanda's premier scientist - waltzes away with every scene in which she appears.It may come as a surprise to some that Marvel's latest superhero blockbuster tackles issues of race, representation and discrimination in so bold and unflinching a manner. And yet, fans of the comic books that have inspired Marvel's entire slate of films would say: it's about time. In the way it embraces its story and heritage, in the way its heroes are presented, and in the way its message will inspire and empower generations to come, Black Panther matters. And it cannot - and will not - be ignored.",10 March 2018," This may be Marvel's 18th film, but it feels like the studio is just getting started.

I have never seen Africa and African culture depicted in such a beautiful way in a live action movie. Hollywood movies always paint Africa in colors that matches its name under British colonization, ""The Dark Continent"". We see movies of slave trade, blood soaked diamond industry, starvation and poverty. I've always wondered this can't be all that Africa has to offer. Though it is based in a mythical country and superpowers, it gave us a glimmer of what Africa would have looked like if European and middle eastern invaders sucked it dry of it's resources. In black panther we see a world set in Africa with bare minimal of those usual stereotypes about the continent. It is a breath of fresh air.The splash of color was a balm to the eyes and music, well i might need to write another review about how good music in this movie was. The end credits score for the movie was phenomenal.
Every character had his\her moment to shine. And all the actors did their characters justice. Black Panther's little sister Shuri was a delight to watch. Micheal B Jordan as the Killmonger was exceptional and up their with Loki when it comes to Marvel villains.",19 February 2018," One step in MCU's master plan and a mile for the Hollywood movie industry

405,mdtactay,"I am an avid fan of sci fi and action movies. Lately (for years now), I have gone to the theaters feeling empty after watching these newer films - they leave me wanting more and better - more action, better story line, better acting, better character development. However, after watching Black Panther, I think I have a little hope for movies restored in me. Without going into it, the story line was easy to follow, easy enough for kids and complex enough for adults to ponder as well. The acting from every single cast member was great, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, and Danai Guirira stole the damn show. Danai Gurira's character (Okoye), I think stole the fight scenes, and I wasn't mad about it. The fight scenes were great, really took me back to the glory days of movies (without too much CGI). You definitely get character growth and development in this movie. Kudos to the director and cast for putting 100% authenticity into this movie.

Was surprised by so much of this sort of ""anti-hype"" criticism. I believe some used to the typical super hero flick of Today, simply want pulse-pounding action every minute, with a few wise-cracks thrown in, and maybe half-decent lines delivered. This is different, and that old formula is so tired and played at this point in the MCU. This story, the special effects, the intrigue, and the action were all superb. However, what was truly phenomenal was the acting by such a massive cast. This just doesn't happen in action, let alone super hero flicks, even today. Those who refuse to see it for the racial reason or know people like that. Tell them it really is just that good beyond the racial make-up, then tell them a White hero actually figures prominently in the end, so don't fret... ;-)",20 February 2018," Worth the hype!

415,myra_mcneill,"The so called ""objective"" reviews of this film are probably just part of the Facebook campaign that was reportedly going to ""ruin"" the reviews by posting negative ones before the movie started. Though Facebook took that group down, the completely fabricated and racially tinged dislike of this movie by many of the 3 and below star reviews makes it obvious the plan was still a go. I love the Marvel universe films, and this one did not disappoint. The CGI and effects were just as good as any other film, the fight and action scenes were just as well choreographed. If anything the hand to hand combat scenes were more impressive than I've seen in a Marvel movie in a long time. Most of the time people are wearing their uniforms etc..., not shirtless on a waterfall. The story line was one of the most complicated and multilayered in Marvel history. And for those who don't believe a superhero movie should have any politics in it: Are you Serious? What IS a superhero movie without some political agenda. You are literally going to the movies to watch superhumans who are supposed to save the world! Where was this dislike of political agenda with the Hydra/Nazi storyline that has been on going for Captain America and the like? Was that not politics? The fight to stop the resurgence of a radical enemy who tried to take over the world and is still operating today? Come on Son! The biggest problem many will have when they see this film is perspective. If you are someone who can't relate to characters that don't look and sound like you- then don't see this movie. If you have a larger less myopic world view, you'll enjoy this. By the way, my theater was ethnically mixed, and we laughed all the way thru the film. If you are only going to ""hate watch it"" then don't go. Save your money. As for the political agenda- the only one I see is situating an Brown Skinned Superhero at the center of a superhero story. One who comes from privilege and not poverty. Offering little children of color to see themselves reflected on screen in a positive and empowering light. Giving them the idea there is a place for them in the super hero catalog. If that is a radical political message you don't support- that says way more about you than the film.

419,drewd-20229,"Although I see a lot of people writing bad reviews based on the opinion that it was ""over hyped"", to me, this film exceeded the hype. I would consider myself a pretty average superhero fan, holding Marvel movies to a basic standard of good action, fun dialogue, engaging plot and thought out characters. This movie easily checks off all of those categories, while bringing others into the spotlight such as stunning visuals, well developed world building and lore, diversity in casting, thought provoking villains and complete badass-ery. As much as I can rant and rave about this movie, I noticed one critical flaw. There's a point in time where the writers decided to force the rotting corpse of a dead meme down the audience's throats that really took away from the atmosphere. Not one person in the theatre laughed, while lots were groaning in disappointment. 
Black Panther has it's own quirky dialogue between characters that counts as ""fun"", but if you enter the theatre hoping for Antman, Avengers or Guardians, you will be let down. Try and appreciate the movie's more serious tone as they tackle heavy topics such as classism, racism, segregation, globalism, terrorism, and many other ""isms"" worth addressing on the big screen. They do all this, without making the movie feel like a college lecture, but an entertaining superhero flick. Ultimately, Black Panther gets all of the right kinds of conversations started. To me, this movie outshone the spotlight, raised the bar for all other superhero movies, dropped the mic and left me speechless.

423,Jared_Andrews,"This movie is awesome. Let's get that out of the way first. It's not the best movie ever, as some claim. It's probably not even the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it is at least worthy of that conversation, which is saying a lot.  Black Panther ascended to levels of hype and promise that seemed nearly unreachable-and it reached them. It's virtually unprecedented for a movie to live up to these outlandish expectations, but that's exactly what it did.  So, what is this movie that climbed all the way into the top five all time at the U.S. box office? Enter Wakanda, a fictitious African country posing as just another third-world nation, but it is secretly the technologically advanced nation in the world because it rests on a mountain on vibranium, the strongest metal in the MCU. Wakanda's king, T'Chaka, was recently killed in an attack, so his son T'Challa is set to assume the throne. T'Challa also fulfills the role of Black Panther, a cunning and powerful warrior featuring superhuman powers supplied by a Wakandian plant and stylish and functional suit made of vibranium.  Wakanda is fiercely loyal to its traditions and to its people. It opts to interact minimally with the outside world and lets in no outsiders, as to protect its secret wealth. This way of life is threatened by the resurfacing of buried stories from the past and the arrival of an outsider who believes Wakanda can no longer sit comfortably as billions in other countries across the globe suffer. T'Challa is forced to deal with the challenges of being a good man and a good king as he navigates the dilemma of staying true to Wakanda's rigid tradition or adapting to a more progressive philosophy.  Chadwick Boseman plays the role of T'Challa with exceptional poise, grace and an absolutely regal accent. He would have been the true standout of the movie if not for several other standout performances. 
Danai Gurira (Michonne of The Walking Dead) shines as General Okoye, the king's go-to warrior. Her love, W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), though on screen less, plays just as significant a role, as he is one of the strongest voices pushing for change to Wakanda's international policy. And, of course, Kaluuya steals a few scenes with his remarkably expressive acting.  Additional shouts to Winston Duke for his role as an intimidating leader of a Wakandian tribe with a dark sense of humor, a low-key warmth, and a penchant for barking. And another one to Sterling K. Brown for playing T'Chaka's brother, a spy dispatched in Oakland who sees the struggles of people firsthand. The greatest standout of the all the standouts is Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. His intense presence fills the room in every scene he enters. He exudes such charisma with his American street manner of speaking and swagger that I almost found myself rooting for him, despite his violent and murderous tendencies. Even in his worst moments, he is always sure of his purpose and his message, which is a compelling one. This message, paired with his backstory, make him easy to empathize with.Another thing: Killmonger is powerful and scary. He's more than a worthy adversary for Black Panther. At times he appears to the be Black Panther's better. Like Bane in Dark Knight Rises, an intelligent villain capable of physically overwhelming the hero, he feels like a real threat. We legitimately believe he can win. It comes as no surprise that his fight scenes with Black Panther will leave you breathless. The action sequences deliver all the thrills you would expect from a Marvel movie and from a Ryan Coogler movie (he's now 3 for 3 in his directorial efforts). But the deeper social themes and inner conflicts of the key characters are what elevates this movie to elite status. Yes, seeing a movie with predominantly Black actors and a Black director is also important. It's important to viewers, young viewers most of all, and it's also important to movie studios. Hopefully Black Panther's booming success will finally dispel the myth that movies with Black lead actors don't do well in the box office. Before I wrap up, I have to give credit to Andy Serkis for his rare non-CGI performance. The guy comes in and throws 100mph from the jump and manages to be hateable, funny, and fun throughout. And final shout outs to Angela Bassett, for playing the royal and majestic mother of T'Challa, and to Letitia Wright, for playing T'Challa's wisecracking tech genius little sister, Shuri.  Apologies to anyone I didn't spotlight. This movie is flooded with incredible performances, so I had to omit a couple mentions to keep this review to a reasonable word count.  Bottom line: go see Black Panther. If you already saw it, see it again. It's that good. It deserves all the praise, and I hope to see it next year at the Oscars.",27 April 2018," As Spectacular as Advertised

426,oliverdimitri,"Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10.

My friend was still mourning the character deaths, so I took her home, bought another ticket and went straight back to that theater. This movie is marvelous. Not only am I a hardcore Marvel fan, but I am also a film student and a writer. I absolutely admire and give my applaud to Marvel, for having the patience, the courage, the directors, the producers, the cast, and the crew spending a decade turning 70 years worth of comics into this beloved franchise that brought those stories and characters to life.I'm going to do my best to keep this short and sweet, without spoilers. This movie should be getting nothing but appreciation and praise. This movie is for the fans, not trolls, not critics. The Russo brothers did exceptional, balancing each character perfectly to their own spotlight. Nothing felt over done or unnecessary, every moment was completely motivated and executed beautifully. The character pairings were well thought out, mended well, the character growth and interactions were fun, and I nearly lost it from excitement. Any scene with Thanos was amazing and stressful, his character arc was well developed and almost made me feel for his gentle side, but whenever he walked on screen I was scared for the heroes lives!! The actors, as always, were incredible, but their performances in Infinity War were outstanding, they all deserve Oscars. Despite the few heartwarming jokes and banter, the movie never shifted from it's serious tone, which I appreciate, as the actors held strong emotional moments that will undoubtedly leave you teary-eyed and heartbroken. This movie will leave you laughing, it will leave you shocked by the twists and turns, it will possibly leave you gasping horrified (like me) or screaming (like some fans), and the ending will leave you emotionally crippled by the cliffhanger, but you will be awestruck.The only thing that I wish was a little different was I wish the score was a little less dramatic and more softer and powerful to deliver that emotion further. I wish they got Hans Zimmer to score the Avengers, but I'm not removing a star for that, because all in all Avengers: Infinity War is a masterpiece, and it takes a lot for me to called a movie a masterpiece, even if its Marvel, but Infinity War pasted all expectations.

Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a cliché, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...",28 April 2018," Absolute Perfection - Exceeds All Expectations and Blows You Away. Best Marvel Film Yet.

As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off.

This movie is fantastic. After 18 movies, the Directors/writers had to make a decision:Either write the movie for the critics: Making clear mini arcs to all the characters, plus a theme, plus ""time for the movie to rest, quiet moments"" blah blah blah.Or write the movie that the MCU deserved.

It's NOT awful, and while it's by far not the best television show I've seen in recent years, it's by far not the worst.It's sad to see the media bash this show so much, when in reality, it actually has a lot of potential. Characters such as Black Bolt, Medusa, Lockjaw, Crystal are likable, heroic and have truly interesting powers. And yes, the animation could have been a bit better on some of the stunts, but that should be expected of a series aimed for television. This is ABC, not HBO. You get what you pay for. Fortunately, the show has enough fascinating aspects and genuinely unique characters, that it somehow works. It's fun-to-watch, entertaining, and at least has a somewhat-believable story line.For Marvel fans and any fans of the original Inhumans comic books, I would highly recommend this show, as it is criminally underrated, and the media is stomping on something that, without all the bad press, would likely be very well received.

However the actors are talented. Iwan Rheon is great as Maximus and Anson Mount does a good job of using his facial expressions to show emotions. It may not deserve a 10 but it doesn't deserve the low rating it has. This show has a lot of potential and even if you don't see it in theaters, I suggest watching it when it comes to TV.

452,imbatman-05856,"To start off, this show has gotten a lot of flack for various reasons. Primarily is the fact that the characters overall look different from their comic book counterparts. Mostly this is due to the fact that they opted to shy away from superhero spandex. To that I say, ""When has Marvel Studios ever stayed comic book accurate with their costumes?"" In all reality, the answer is rarely. First off, this show has very impressive cinematography as far as camera angles, and spectacle goes. The sets fair well for a sci-fi family that lives on Earth's moon. Though the script isn't always firing on all pistons, the characters are lovable and intriguing. The actors all visually look the part and are incredible entertainers (just see their backlog of previous work). Standouts in the series include Anson Mount as Black Bolt - with a brooding stoic look to begin with he handles emotion with mere facial expressions perfectly; Lockjaw - amazing CGI especially for a TV series; and Iwan Rheon - he really plays Maximus ""the Mad"" in a sympathetic convincing manner, while in reality, he is ruthless and bad. Other characters in the series only add to the depth of the story. I especially appreciated Isabelle Cornish's innocence in portraying Crystal, while discovering such a beautiful actress was also a plus. Overall the series is off to a good start, while season 2 hopefully gets a different showrunner as Buck's screen writing isn't always the best. Ignore the negativity that comes from critics, and give this series a shot. It's awesome, and hopefully, has the chance to continue.

453,karansingal-59821,"Now, I may have rated it 10. Doesn't mean that it is a 10. Far from it, really. But I enjoyed what I watched and have to rate it higher as people are rating it 1's or 2's without giving it chance and despite it lacking a certain kick that elevates it from just another show to a Marvel brand worthy show, it is still nowhere near as bad as everyone made it seem. In fact, it did show potential. The first episode did a a good job of introducing the Royal Family and their agendas but yes, the 2nd episode fell flat, except the last 10 minutes or so. But we have seen nothing, and I mean nothing from the remaining 6 episodes so, that gives me hope for the series that it will get only better from here.Moreover, just like hating Transformers/BvS is a fad, or hating Michael Bay/Zack Snyder/Scott Buck in general is cool or bashing Gotham is fun as CW DC shows are soooooo much better (NOT!), it has become a recent trend or to hate on anything Marvel TV. Defenders' reception was okay at best; AoS, despite being the flagship of network superhero shows for 2 years now, is on the verge of cancellation; the cancellation of Agent Carter, followed by Most Wanted speaks volumes and don't even get me started on Iron Fist. It was so painfully hated by half the people who didn't even see it in the first place, because of claims of whitewashing.All of this, and the fact that this is being bashed for an IMAX release which was not worthy of cinema. But admittedly, the first 2 episodes were not in fact fit for cinema and certainly not IMAX and were more television valued, due to lack of action scenes and building story but it's still got immense potential and people, just wanting to fit in with the crowd are running the show into the ground, which is sad, as this has the potential to be the Marvel's version of X-Men.

I've read some comments about the stiff acting and bad costuming. But what show doesn't go through its little awkward stage when it starts? I think that if given a chance to have a few seasons the acting will improve (though I really didn't think it was bad at all) and things will get interesting as it goes along. I really dislike rating any show during the first season as its basically not fair to the actors and writers. I haven't seen a series like this before and I think the judgement of it is really unfair. Its basically not the norm and when something isn't exactly like other shows it automatically gets a bad wrap. I wish people will at least save rating this until the second season gets done. At that time it's more fair to the show and you can actually see where its going before just cutting it off. Incredible shows get canceled all the time...Firefly anyone? Its always the super boring shows that rate high. Maybe I'm the only one that sees potential in Inhumans. I guess we'll all see if it gets its chance or if its cut off prematurely.

But that potential has been satisfyingly reached, and continues to increase with every consecutive season. Without giving any spoilers I'd like to know that there are a lot of twists later on in the first and second season, that really make it a lot more worthwhile to hang in for, and when you go and re-watch the first season with those twists in mind, you realize that it wasn't just something they threw in to make it more interesting, it was something they planned from the beginning and dropped little hints towards that no one noticed. Ward was my least favorite character, until his true nature was revealed, and then when you go back and look at it with the experience of later events, you can see that there's much more underneath the surface. They were playing the long con, fooling people and thinking they were an average episodic show, when they had much more in mind for it. I have never been excited for any episode of agents of shield as I am the season three premiere, and I can't wait for the secret warriors story arc. The 10 I'm rating this is a bit preemptive, because I expect that season three maybe one of the best things to happen to the Marvel universe since Iron man 1, but it's also a bit of an apologetic rating for misjudging it early on in the first season. I now prefer agents of shield to arrow which used to be my favorite superhero show, but is now trailing in a close second.The visual effects get a 10 out of 10, on par with supernatural or fringe The acting gets an 8 out of 10, added points for Agent may, Skyes impressive character development, and a lot of the humorous moments between Colson and Nick fury, or the infinite likable agent tripp, points docked for Fitz and Simmons ""trying to sound smart"" speak in season one, although a lot of their more annoying badly written character quirks are ironed out by season two The writing gets a nine out of 10, mostly because hard to write something I don't see coming a mile away, though it might be a bit generous considering a few of the missteps in the early episodes of season oneThe fight choreography gets a nine out of 10 for how well it blends with the visual effects, though it might've been a 10 out of 10 if daredevil hadn't come out with that awesome fight scene in the hallway the same yearI now have nothing but high expectations and hopes for the show and I hope it only improves further. A few areas of improvement include Bobbi Morse who is not likable at all, and maybe some kind of seriously superpowered villain, or possibly the skrull invasion, or something on par with that? So far the major antagonists are a bit interchangeable, Whitehall being the major exception, who is probably the best written villain yet.

470,tpark-46368,"I give this show a solid 8.5, though I rate it as 10 to possibly offset the reviews made based on the first half of the first season. To know what I think, I consider Game of Thrones to be the only 10, because it is probably as good as a TV show can get. The 7.5 score this show currently has probably lives up to the rating... if the score is based on the first 10 or so episodes. The show started off bland and clichéd. The first couple episodes were interesting, and had fun character interactions. But they began to bore really fast as I got accustomed to their personalities. The substance didn't really help at all, because the main plot point didn't seem to go anywhere. However, the show really kicks off at the start of the second half of the first season. The show's plot line didn't rely on the main MCU movies. It offers a nod to the main movies, but the show operates almost independently from whatever is going on in the movies. So even if you are not a big Marvel fan, you can still enjoy the show without knowing much of the movies. The show gets even better in the second, third, and fourth seasons as the show adds new characters and develops existing ones. The boring dynamics of the first couple episodes develop into something great. Along with excellent CGI and action sequences, there's rarely a dull moment in each of the episodes.",6 July 2017," Like Fine Aging Wine: A Show that Keeps Getting Better

475,wiyosaya,"For me, the best drama is willing to explore human nature in all its depth. In such a series, the characters, no matter how powerful they are, will have the same flaws that are exhibited day-to-day in real life by everyone. As I see it, everyone is towing baggage, some more so than others. When drama is willing to explore humanity with realistic characters, I find that compelling because it gives me a chance to reflect on who I am, what I have become, where I have come from, how I treat others, and where I choose to go.If, on top of that, there is a story that weaves together elements of itself over long story arcs, I find that even more compelling.In the current Marvel universe, though I have not yet seen Black Panther and Infinity War is yet to come to the big screen, my favorites so far have been all of the Captain America movies and Doctor Strange (with an honorable mention to the first Guardians of the Galaxy) because they have been willing to explore the depths of humanity in a manner that few other movies or TV series have.I was mildly interested in SHIELD when it first started, however, I did not watch it. After a year or two, I watched what there was of it on Netflix to catch up. I was hooked. From the start, there has been what I think is a depth to it that few other series have ever shown. I found the stories very compelling with multiple episode story arcs that were, in my eyes, interesting enough to keep watching.I have seen every episode of SHIELD so far, and to me, it just keeps getting better. Season 5 started out in a fashion that I thought was significantly different than all the other seasons of SHIELD. I like variety, and I was willing to go with it - much as I have gone with every Doctor in both classic and modern Doctor Who. Season 5 of SHIELD intrigued me with its differences from the previous seasons, and though it was, to me anyway, very different, I kept watching. I found myself liking what I was watching and then at one point early in the season, I found myself saying, ""SHIELD has really outdone itself with this season.""And then came season five's episode 14: The Devil ComplexAs I see it, few, if any TV series have ever had an episode willing to explore humanity in such depth as this episode and weave together elements from several prior seasons. For me, this may be the best episode of a TV series ever. The Devil Complex is a masterpiece right up there with the rare other episodic TV series masterpieces like Star Trek's The City on the Edge of Forever.As I see it, this series is the best of all of the Marvel universe that I have seen at this time, and may be one of the best TV series of all time.

I liked it best among the superhero shows at season 2.

Maybe only The Wire and Game of Thrones are keeping ahead, but I'm not sure how long. Is it perfect? No. The action isn't AAA Hollywood quality, the acting is only above average most of the time (although sometimes it's brilliant) and there are some silly stuff going on, but even then it's pretty amazing compared to anything I ever seen.

I am so excited for this cast even after just one episode, despite not having seen many of them before. I had no doubt that Gregg would play his part perfectly, but the others were just as great in their respective roles, giving life to new characters and delivering their lines with perfect comedic and dramatic timing. In addition to the quality of the cast, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the main cast is equally male and female, and that two of those females were women of colour.

Such a progression is very rare to find in television, but Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. does it spectacularly. Not only does the show have quality, but it also has a diverse cast consisting of people with different races, sexuality, and religion. This creates a sense that everyone, no matter who society tells them they are, can matter like the characters on the show. Over the past four seasons, the plot took a surprising turn in season four with the splitting of the plot into three ""pods"", a format never to be seen in the superhero genre. This format not only kept the interest of the viewers, but helped the Marvel show to become critically acclaimed during its fourth season. With the coming of season five in December, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will reach its 100th episode.

507,sbucklar,"As a long term comic book nerd, and a huge fan of the Marvel cinematic universe and television properties - I wasn't sure what to make of the proposed Street Heroes development deal with Netflix, especially in light of the history with those characters in film (Affleck's disappointing Daredevil in particular). I was however pleasantly optimistic from the teaser releases.I am breath taken with the end result. Vincent D'Onofrio is to my mind the standout star and an act of sheer casting genius as Kingpin. The menace and complexity in his voice even when he's not on screen, and the cold, calculating and distant aspect of his body language, and the delivery of his dialogue, shows both the depth of his talent as an actor and the brilliance of his casting. As a long term fan of D'Onofrio - and a huge fan of the king pin in the comic book universe - I'm thrilled at the prospect of his continued involvement with the Marvel cinematic universe.The sound editing for the series in general, from D'Onofrio's voice overs to the audible representations of the protagonist's enhanced senses is a triumph. It begs to be recognized and awarded. It is perhaps as integral to success of the series as the performance of any of the characters.Also, Deborah Ann Woll who played Jessica Hamby in True Blood remains equally gifted as an actress, stunning as an aesthetic work of art, and for a moment, just a little bit more naked than she was in her prior works. Which after 71 episodes of true blood with a celebrity crush on her - has to be a acknowledged as part of the reason for my immediate fondness for the series. But as talented as she is, the show would stand as remarkable even without her.In the interest of fairness, there are some rough moments in the dialogue. The visual effects have moments of awkwardness in the earlier episodes. There is a sense in a few corners of the production group finding its feet. But it does seem to level out (and up) as the story progresses.",10 April 2015," A reason to sign up for Netflix, all other facts aside

I am a huge fan of the Daredevil comics, my favourite run being by Bendis and Maleev, and this show is how you would imagine a Daredevil TV show being. It's a dark, gritty sombre affair with some great action, there is a fight scene in episode two which is truly amazing.Talking about action the best part for me is the action feels very realistic and brutal unlike the Daredevil film with its over the top wire work. Also very good in this show is the way his powers aren't shown in any fancy way, no sonar view or anything like that, it just emphasise his listening. The actors are all great too and the plots are compelling, just now I have nothing bad to say about this show.When marvel got back the rights to Daredevil I was a little apprehensive of how they would portray his character, no worries there now I've seen it, or if they would use the character at all. I was worried if he did get his own show/film it'd be like the rest of the Marvel films/shows, light hearted action with great fan service and a good helping of comedic moments, which wouldn't of suited the dark world of Daredevil. But I can safely say to all you fellow hornhead fans that they have nailed everything about Daredevil perfectly.I would highly recommend this show to Daredevil fans and fans of darker heroes like Batman, fans of the current MCU films/shows might not like the tonal change from those films/shows but it's exactly what the character needed.

I was so impressed by the depth of the series. Last one was Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. However, due to the restricted background set by batman comics, its no wonder that the society depicted in the trilogy was not that real, or a little bit aloof.

The main players are at the moment still evolving, the acting is on par with the script and I hope they can keep it up to this standard and not fall into that ""lazyness"" that sometimes appears after a few shows. It would seem once again choosing a non-American as lead has paid-off. It's like the fresh blood into a dying species. So, for fans of the not so run of the mill comic adaption I can thoroughly recommend this, and for all those out there that need everything to be bright, colourful and loud you should watch this just to see how good something can be without all that. That makes it sound boring but I can assure you, you may just be as surprised as I was.Update: Finished season 1 and I have nothing but praise for this show and can't wait for season 2.

It does everything right and even better than the first 2 seasons. This new season really fleshes out every character so much more, Matt himself, Karen, Foggy, KINGPIN, Dex, holy cow! For villainous performances, D'Onofrio was BORN to play Wilson!!! He is even a better Kingpin than in the Spiderman Ps4 game! All Netflix Kingpin has to do is sit with a straight face and still look like he will choke a person out or put a head through a table at any moment. You do not see Vincent on Kingpin at all... This is the best role of his career! Before season 3 showed up, I knew NOTHING about Ben Poindexter in the world of Marvel as far as comics or whatever.. This show gives you Pointexter's entire backstory all at once, but so cleverly well done, omg! How it does it is a long process, but NEVER drags or takes you out of the show! How Dex is portrayed in this show, when he is in the spotlight, you somewhat give a crap about him. This season gives the audience who has never picked up a comic, like myself...all the help needed to learn way more about Matt, Karen, Foggy, etc in through the best performances I have ever seen in this show..

One of the ways was to include them the bigger hero's movies but it never feels like they are doing the characters justice.

But the person Pointdexter has also great depth and keeps the viewers interest at all times.Fisk turning full Kingpin was also nice delivered.

This season also had the best fighting scenes. I mean some of the were just awsome... The prison one-shot scene, exceptional. As was the finale with the Triple Threat going on, surely Fisk was the Final Boss but it didn't feel like it as it felt shared between them both. Not one character had a bad performance.✍ Next season i would like for new villains to be introduced, and DD showed us that when one hero's show is cancelled after another he is getting just better and better at captivating the audience.

As a villain, he's right up there with Heath Ledger's Joker.Krysten Ritter (Jesse's girlfriend from season 2 of Breaking Bad) plays the lead. It's great to see a Female Marvel lead, and she delivers a wonderfully understated performance. The show starts off as a gritty detective show with dry humour and not much of Tennant. However, as the show goes along, it evolves into something much cooler. It gets darker but also funnier, and Tennant's involvement becomes larger.In conclusion, Jessica Jones is a very binge-able show with a memorable villain and a great lead that doesn't need much prior knowledge despite tying into the Marvel universe.

Any fan of the comic books will be hard pressed to fault Jessica Jones or Luke Cage. Their chemistry and dynamic is ink made flesh and the characters that we loved brought to screen.

Taking away the flash of Hollywood block-busters puts a great burden on both the plot and actors, and Jessica Jones excels in both.The series is a must-see for anyone who likes a good thriller. Rather than using superpowers or alien gadgets, the main character's search for the villain is good old-fashioned PI work. The superpower that has the most relevance to the plot, mind-control of the wonderfully evil villain Kilgrave played by David Tennant, is not used in a quest to destroy the world but rather to pose difficult ethical questions: What would you do if you had the ultimate power?

Beneath Jessica Jones' ability to throw 300-lb. guys through walls is an aching fragility. She is conflicted, boozy, peeved, sh*t-talking, embraces her own sexuality, thinks fast on her feet, and is devoted to what she does. Jessica's bordering-on-con- artist skills as a private detective are especially entertaining.Fair warning: There are sexually explicit scenes–-no nudity but, whoah--and occasional gore (maybe every three episodes.) More than any other series except Orange is the New Black, Jennifer Jones brims with a perfect cast of interesting, strong female characters, notably Carrie-Ann Moss of Matrix/Trinity fame and Australian actress, Rachael Taylor, probably best known by American audiences as Maggie Madsen in Transformers (2007--and for looking an awful lot like a grownup 24's Elisha Cuthbert.In case you haven't watched Jennifer Jones yet, I'll hold back from revealing which actor was chosen to play the sociopathic, mind-controlling super villain, but I will say this: the casting choice was brilliant.",27 December 2015," A Marvel-ous Binge Watch

David Tennant is equally good as an enamored sociopath and probably the first mass murder I have ever seen in film/television who is genuinely amusing (whenever he is not repulsive). The interaction between the two is a good enough reason to watch the show alone, and the amazing writing is only matched by the skill of the actors delivering their lines.

537,taryllsbaker,"Jessica Jones is the next instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), following on from Daredevil, which also premiered this year. Set in the same Hell's Kitchen, Jessica Jones takes a look at dark tones and topics such as depression, guilt, sex, death, rape and assault; and this only makes the story drive more. Daredevil was dark, but this is much, much darker.Firstly, one of the things that stood out for me right from the start is the beautiful cinematography and direction. This show looks stunning; there's so much colour and vibrancy, not only in the backdrop, but in the characters too. Jessica is played by Krysten Ritter (Breaking Bad), who surprisingly, without any major roles thus far, shines throughout the season in a powerful, yet gentle and subtle performance. David Tennant is incredible with his take on Kilgrave. I originally had no expectations for his character, or his performance before watching. But he really is convincing and quite menacing, and creepy at times. The music by Sean Callery is stunning and eerie, just as it should be. The titles are the first thing you see, each episode, so it had to capture your attention straight away. And it does. With 'elevator music' elements and subtle piano melodies, it all kicks off soon when the percussion drives in and takes control with blasting electric guitars and solo- like touches which really pulls the mood together; then, finally settles you with the main title logo. Perfect.It's worth noting that although Jessica has 'special' powers, there aren't any huge scenes when special effects are used to amplify these moments of power and force. It's mostly camera tricks to show her strength and 'jumping and falling' powers. So, if you're planning on watching for an over-the-top smash fest, you won't find it here. Also, if you're ignoring the age certificate then I'll warn you, there are a couple scenes of a sexual nature.My verdict; Jessica Jones is another insanely good instalment to the MCU canon and should not be missed by any fan of Marvel. It even attracts the 'noir' feel which has major potential to entertain even the casual comic book fan. This is by far one of the best Marvel series yet, and possibly forever will be.Jessica Jones, 10/10.",30 November 2015," 'AKA Review'

And I have to tell you people, I'm not into superheroes. I started watching Jessica Jones with high expectations, as Daredevil made me cry, smile and start training again, and I was quite disappointed by the first 2-3 episodes. But then, the magic came out and about. This show is grittier than both the others, although just in the sense that it's an emotional challenge to sit through. Now, characters are round and nice, all have some characteristics (no pun intended) that makes them likable. Even Kilgrave.

539,psychedelicgirl,"NY. ""De Niro"" nostalgia for Hell Kitchen, and atmosphere that impregnated with the snow and frost, the wind and the pouring rain. It recalls the Mysterious soft Halloween in coffee houses or Gotham East End or the real Bronx, and yellow-red extravaganza fall, and now rainy December in Moscow... And seems as if Jessica Jones lives with us, here and now, here and there, not in parallel, but it is in our universe, goes not only inside the red-brick borough of New England, but also among the medieval Moscow streets, elegant ragged jeans, a bottle of expensive whiskey in her sloppy bag and she is super lady all the same. It seems as she goes upstairs into the next to your an apartment somewhere on the Bronnaya Street or Zemlyanoy Val Street, she opens her laptop Acer (not any MacBook or Sony Vaio, mind you!). And eliminates the world's evil in the same way as it can do and you.Yes, I like easy and unconstrained fashion of 2010-2015 in this film. Just like in ""8Sense"" or ""Orphan Black"" or ""Pretty Little Liars."" Now Netflix is successful, on this way, don't know as Marvel. Like realistically show the life of New York and the Hell Kitchen, a modern, no flowery hippie times or infinitely-violent times of the 60's. Like the fact that, really «what does not kill you makes it more strange». We live in the post-epoсh of the banditry, and in the post- informality. It seems all the ideals that derived to a movement of humanity are ended, and Generation Y is thuggee or have suffocated in the format of their Facebook or ""vcontakte"". We have already passed a quantum leap into the future, we notice it or not, I do not know, but here it came - here and now. Very good was looked the truth about ""Troll New Age"", that called just so now, about people with psychic abilities, which, of course, use them for power and control. A great find the authors of the series have been invited for the role of David Tennant: he plays the role of psychopaths very good. As well good idea about experiments on the creation of a ""super-soldiers"" of how it gets out of control and causing damage to the surrounding life. At least the problem posed and in art now. I like New Yorker attitude to work - they all work, and a lot of work, considered a disgrace to be idlers (do not tell about us, Russians, where all deify two things: business and nightclubs). I like the openness of American people to each other, and, as usual, loyalty in friendship and love for the person what I love in American movies.And, of course, like the heroine Kristen Ritter: strong, clever, discreet, romantic and realistic at the same time - with an inner core, free, and so, without feminism or social declarations: I think it is too close to the Russian «apolitical audience», huh, take my thoughts like lol. We are looking for ""heroes"", but many of us want to see in them not only a victory over extreme situations, but also to win over every day, and we must win in our usual life. And in Jessica, I personally see for myself a hero, ""the hero of our time."" She owns himself and his life, it does not suffer from ""nouveau Rich syndrome"" ( when the poor people start to get dressed ""to the nines"" and buy ""golden gadgets"" to show that they are ""no longer the poor"" - is typical of Brooklyn, for immigrants from third world countries, for our country). She knows how to love and choose the coolest and handsome man - the only one - who, in my opinion, he deserves her and he is Luke (Mike Colter); she knows how to build and maintain a lifetime true friendship with Trisha (great game ""of the protagonist-2» Rachael Taylor), and she not in all of this no one false note: even weakness she plays perfectly without a shadow of a lie. She easily outputs from the state of vegetation her friend Malcolm (Eyck Darvill) and removes this needle-addict from life, because now we do not need in «Requiem for a Dream» more nothing (as aptly named Man passersby) because today we have little time for this ""games"".

The big discovery for me was a bit part in the performance of Dr. Claire (Rosario Dawson) in a few minutes during the care for Luke in the apartment Jessica, she reveals her charismatic potential as actress and the potential of her character.

540,malmborgimplano-92-599820,"To me Jessica Jones succeeds in what The Dark Knight and V For Vendetta never really managed to do, which is to merge the comic book fantasy of heroes with phenomenal powers into the world of the grown-up crime thriller. Reading the reviews here I see a lot of fans of the traditional superhero genre saying ""What the hell did I just watch here?"" But as someone who's a fan of classic movies I recognize all the earmarks of film noir, especially films like ""Stranger on the Third Floor"" and ""Kiss Me Deadly"" that combine elements of fantasy with the dark urban mystery genre. Jessica is a noir detective antihero along the bloodlines of Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade. But Jessica is a thoroughly modern woman and her pedigree clearly indicates a connection with Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock as well, and I think that in her own way Kristen Ritter has created as memorable a character out of her Jessica as Cumberbatch has with his Sherlock. (Admittedly her Sherlockian black rinse and white makeup could be part of that effect.)The Sherlock connection extends to her nemesis Kilgrave, who I realize derives from the Purple Man in the original graphic novels, but who in this version is very much a post-Heath Ledger Joker antisupervillain in the manner of Andrew Scott's Moriarty. When I first saw clips of David Tennant's Kilgrave I was puzzled by why he was using an estuarial English accent for the character but I think it's because (a) an upper class Englishman wouldn't have used powers like his for such comparatively trivial purposes--he would have gone straight to the City of London or Westminster and set to work manipulating whole nations and economies, not individuals-- and (b) as a Scotsman he wouldn't libel a fellow Scot by making Kilgrave one of them. After all it wasn't Andrew Scott who chose to make Moriarty a fellow Dubliner, it was Moffat and Gatiss made him do it.",2 May 2016," Superheroes in a film noir world

I don't want to take away anything from Daredevil or Luke Cage (both excellent shows) but the acting, the story, and the character development in this show are just phenomenal. Jessica Jones, the title character, is the personification of what a bad-ass female lead looks like. Alcoholic, cynical, bitingly sarcastic, she is the woman that everybody both hates and admires. Virtually every supporting cast member that I could think of have exceptionally well developed characters and backgrounds. The Bad Guy is pretty damn bad (in the good way) but is so affable he comes across as a guy who you would tell your social security number to. The series handling of controversial topics like PTSD, alcoholism, substance abuse, assault, rape, and a few other things I can't think of right now are done with a candidness that is rare even on many ""premium"" cable shows. It is like this show itself, while a fictional TV show based around a comic book character, is actually a statement on real life society (something that seems emboldened by the lead's occasional voice-over narration throughout the series). Watching the characters in this show I often found myself on the edge of my seat in anticipation of the next betrayal or the next death. While there are good guys and bad guys here going through the first season episode by episode I found myself examining the characters on the screen just waiting to see if the hidden demon that I suspected was hiding in them would come out.10/10.

New York looks like a miserable place like Scorcese's Taxi Driver. The main female protagonist Jessica Jones is a sarcastic, tortured, unlikable character who tries to redeem herself by doing the right thing by people in a crappy world, the series turns sexual stereotypes on their heads, the main villain is a sick pervert, innocents get truly preyed upon and manipulated in the foulest of ways for KilGrave's twisted desires.

544,keahnaparker,"In the Netflix series ""Marvel's Jessica Jones"" is a fantastic and brilliant series. It is about a woman named Jessica Jones working as a personal investigator. When Jones was a teen her family got into a brutal car crash that killed her parents and her little brother. After the car crash Jones was adopted. While dealing with the drama between her new sister (Trish) and mom she found out that she had certain abilities that made her stronger than the average teen. When Jones got older she tried to become a person that used her abilities for good. One day when she was doing good a man named Kilgrave seen her. Kilgrave, unfortunately, had abilities too but his was mind control. He could get people to do what he wanted. Kilgrave wasn't the she superhero he was more of the super villain that fell in love with a hero (Jones). After all the bad he made Jones do she eventually go immune to his commands and felt it was her job to take him out but only with the help of friends and loved ones, like Luke Cage and Trish.I love this show because it has a wonderful story line and it is full of drama. The story line was great because it like you never lost interest and you always want to know more. Also, because it wasn't just your typical Marvel movie. It was like a story about a regular person that just happen to get certain abilities because they were used as an experiment that went bad but in a way good. Jones doesn't even want to be known as a hero. In fact, she is the total opposite. She is always drunk, never shows her feelings towards anyone, and lives in a crappy house that don't even have a proper door on it.The drama of the show is what also makes it worth looking at. It's a big love triangle. Jones loves Trish and all her neighbors that she eventually becomes close to. But instead of saying it she treats them the worst and protecting them is the way she shows her love. She also meets a man named Luke Cage which was a one night stand but it turned out to be the last person she killed husband and the only man she could see a future with. Then there was Kilgrave. Kilgrave loved Jones so much that he didn't want to control her he wanted Jones to love him on her own. The only thing is that he went about it the wrong way. He tried to force her to love him by killing others. With this great story line and endless drama Netflix series ""Marvel's Jessica Jones"" is a wonderful and brilliant show to see.",5 March 2017," It is wonderful!

The first season of DD was definitely off to a slow start but then slowly picked up pace, and had a nice finish for season 2. So I decided to watch Jessica Jones since I was dying for a season 3 of DD. I watched the first episode and I was actually pretty impressed. Im a huge marvel fan, I didn't know much about JJ, the only thing i did know was that she had super strength and that she was the wife of Luke Cage. After watching the 1st episode I was attached to the show, I finished the whole season in a week. Holy Sh*t it was amazing. There was so much action and I was so attached to the charters, the acting is amazing, I'd recommend this show to anyone who loves marvel.

I am glad on the trailer part because most trailers give away too much anyways. I think because of that I was able to get sucked in right away. From the first episode I was hooked into this dark yet realistic like world of a superhero who doesn't take crap from anyone. Most superheroes are like that but this one was handled and brought to our screens a bit differently. Her picture was painted with large brush strokes from the start to show us a vivid character portrait of what it is like to be a superhero in the real world. Not all superheroes wear capes and not all superheroes make good choices. As soon as the show opens with Jones doing her normal day to day investigating routine you are invested because of how good this show is made. This show is very well written and directed. And the acting is superb from the lead actress, Krysten Ritter, as well as the rest of the cast. This show deserves to be seen and you should watch it, clearly if you are reading this you probably are already interested. I am telling the truth when it comes to viewing this show though, it's so worth your attention it's not like the cookie cutter superhero films we have been getting almost every year. Not to say those films are bad because they are not. But this is finally something different that actually explores real issues too other then just aliens attacking New York City.

It is wholly refreshing that the sexual manipulation play book is rarely used in this series (if ever) by either the male or female characters. It is also wholly refreshing to find inflicted direct violence used less as a means of manipulation (rather than suggestion), but, when used, that it can be employed by either sex.

549,arodox-59760,"I had high hopes for this show after how good the first season of daredevil was, and i have to say they were definitely met. Finally, a female hero that isn't some idealized 2 dimensional mary sue ""strong independent woman"" stereotype. In fact what this show does so well is show how hollow that stereotype is, on the outside jessica might be strong, but on the inside she is fragile and self loathing, on the outside she might be independent, but on the inside her foundation is crumbling and she can barely keep it together without help which she never asks for and constantly pushes away. Its a show with raw emotional depth and superpowers, and those two are so very rarely seen in combination.But i think the most fantastic aspect of Jessica Jones is its portrayal of Kilgrave, the purple man, as he deals with the spoiling and moral corruption of getting everything he wants, all the time. I've recently considered why there aren't enough, or really any shows on TV that explore the darker side of aspiration, what people are willing to do with limitless resources and power and what that does to a man, and this is something this show tackles extremely well. At face value Kilgrave is a jealous sadistic manchild who gets everything he wants so he wants the one thing he can't have--but peel a layer deeper and its clear he wants to lose. He wants to flirt with danger, have a genuine interaction that isn't everything he demands, only he's so far removed from even knowing what that looks like that it becomes a sociopathic game of chess trying to extort free will out of someone when he already has control over peoples, well how should i put it--less than free will. And everyone likes to talk about the sensationalist PC aspect of it that deals with rape but the issues that it touches on go so much further that to the very idea of liberty and freedom itself. Personally in my own life i was locked up for 3 years unconstitutionally, and they tried to control my free will, tried to torture me into making certain choices, but no matter how hard they tried they could never violate me in the way that kilgrave does to people with ease which makes the implications of his power so much more unsettling. And the idea that jessica herself is this force of nature with super strength and even Luke cage is all that and bulletproof skin--and all that and anyone or anything else she throws at him could be immediately under his control with a word--makes him all the more untouchable, which becomes a moral hazard for all of his countless atrocities, which are equal parts sadistic and creative.Ultimately the character development gets a 10/10 from me, and the plot gets a 9/10, the special effects were ultimately secondary to what was most impressive about this, but they weren't bad by any means, perhaps a 6/10. the cinematography also gets a 10/10, especially whoever did all the color grading, as you can even feel the color purple creep into subtle parts of the urban jungle as if to suggest kilgrave--or someone under his influence--is waiting around any corner. And the action was not as good as daredevil but ultimately satisfactory, lets say, a 7/10.It is an amazing show, but please, do not watch this and talk about the supposed points it makes or dialogue it starts about ""rape culture"", or whatever. It makes no such points and you are an obnoxious douchebag.",23 November 2015," Kilgrave Made Me Watch It

550,mickeythecudder,"Everyone did the best they could. The performances are great and every actor here is in their best shape. The pilot episode is one of my favorites, even though it had no action.. I understand SOME of the negative reviews. What I cant accept is saying the acting is bad, cuz clearly it is captivating. Yes, it would be good to see the raw action Daredevil has and Jessica Jones truly lacks, but there's enough of it, trust me. The 2 or 3 fight scenes at the last episodes seemed like a Tarantino movie.All those idiots that rate it 2 or 3 clearly don't get it. Some said they couldn't feel sympathy for Jessica because she drinks and wears the same clothes everyday, really? Id like to see how would you be after 8 months of mental and physical abuse. Others said Jessica is not the female Daredevil and generally that the show is no Daredevil. Well, let me tell you. I think thats what the makers aimed for.. I mean, Daredevil is great but its a whole other show. If you expected the kickass scenes from Daredevil, you're a moron.Jessica Jones is not a superhero, shes not even close to being a vigilante.. Shes a private eye, not much fighting in that area.. And if you've read the amazing Alias, my favorite comic series, then you know that she didn't usually fight people. Shes really strong and a punch is enough..What I didn't like is the fact that every episode had to do with Kilgrave and it was tiring. Jessica had other business too in the comics.. I would also prefer more flashbacks and stuff from when she was happy, pro-Kilgrave, because those scenes were hilarious and they represented everything Jessica is about. I also have to mention, if you've read Alias first, then I suppose you know how good Krysten Ritter was, I mean every time she made a joke or screamed or was rude to someone, I felt that thats how I pictured it while reading the comic. Also, I loved Malcom, even though his part in Alias was different, and I liked him better as an addict, before he got clean. But one other thing about the comic is that we saw captain America and Ms. Marvel and Ant-Man and all the Avengers so the fact that they couldn't do such a thing in the show makes it less than the comic and its obvious, even though understandable.So, is the show good? Its great. Daredevil was a little better though, so it deserves the 8.8 it currently has here, just a step from Daredevil. But if the show falls more, because it had a 9 rating at first, its not fair and it would not deserve it because of idiots that had no idea what they were about to get on November 20th. And even the negative reviewers gave it a 2, not 1, but 2! Only Kilgrave could make them rate it 1 because they know the show is better than they gave it.",24 November 2015," Amazing.

I will now move onto my review. I will start with the story which is about a women named Jessica Jones obviously who is a PI and she solves cases while dealing with a sadistic villain. I love the story and the vibe of it which flows alongside the movie Sin City and has a very Noir aesthetic which coincides perfectly with the narrations done by Jessica throughout the series. I will now move onto the acting which was Superb. I mean Krysten Ritter as Jessica played a perfect alcoholic/investigator. I even enjoyed Luke Cage played by Mike Colter and the relationship that they form. The rest of the cast did Amazing. I will say though that the character who stole the show for me was Purple Man AKA Killgrave played by David Tennant. He is by far my favorite new villain in the Marvel Universe. I mean he is fiendish, barbarous and Delusional. I loved him and he played his character to perfection. I will now move onto the action which was thoroughly entertaining. I will say it didn't have the action packed scenes of Daredevil but it was a Hell of a lot more psychological which is what gets to you in the end and there are some very bloody scenes that actually surpass DD in many respects. I have never read the comics for Jessica Jones but this show is a show you don't want to miss. I will also say that the sound design and the cinematography were superfluous. I will finish by saying that this initial season was Fantastic and you should watch this show immediately. I promise you will not regret it. I was a tad disappointed in the finale but I have my reasons and I will not spoil that but all in all I applaud Marvel for there 2nd dive into a Marvel inspired television show that has paid off in a dramatic way.",22 November 2015," I'm Jonesing for some more Jessica Jones.

Reviews are intimate, it's about what the show did or didn't make u feel- and with that said I rated JJ 9 out of 10.It isn't a happy-go-lucky feel good show by any stretch of the imagination and unlike other Marvel properties it's dark, intense, and heavy- and explores very adult themes. Krysten Ritter superbly plays the sulking victim turned flawed-heroin to perfection- also worthy of note is the strong casting for Luke Cage as well. But the standout out star in the show is David Tennant's Kilgrave, a misguided sociopath and in some ways, a victim of his own powers. The complexity and full fleshed out character makes him go well beyond your standard villain. His obsession with all things Jessica is fully explored and his motivations are throughly explained.This show wont be for everyone, it's dark tone will no doubt put some off but if you are into complex thrill rides it doesn't get much better than Jessica Jones.

Great job keep it up, Can't wait for the next season!",21 October 2016," Great Start!!!

565,janellewilliams-55398,"So here's the thing: Luke Cage is a show by Black people, for Black people, about Black people. Now if your done crying and feeling oppressed, I'd like to talk about the show.I watch every Marvel show faithfully, and Luke Cage is he most superior by far- that includes Daredevil and Jessica Jones.Mike Colter is truly a work of art (and I'm not just talking about his body). The way he can convey such moving performances without ever raising his voice or even moving around is truly powerful. Simone Missick gives a great breakout performance as Detective Misty Knight while her hair stayed fresh all 13 episodes. Rosario Dawson continues to kick ass as the titular Claire Temple.I won't spoil it any further but I can calmly tell you Luke Cage is the best Marvel show currently in existence. Anyone in denial just hates Black Excellence.",25 October 2016," Ignore the White Tears, This Show Is Great

566,askiajones,"Cheo Hodari Coker has introduced an epic narrative inspired by Marvel's most legendary Black superhero into an artistically cinematic melody delivered in 13 classic bars. This series, Luke Cage, has taken an historical pen and ink concept and painted a polarizing modern day mural like no other hero movie has ever done.The social, political, and historical commentary sprinkled throughout this series was presented with absolute perfection - laced with one of the most beautiful soundtracks I've ever heard.For those viewers or critics who don't get it - just won't get it - because this series is just way too smart for them.",3 October 2016," Absolutely brilliant!

567,tyroga-1,"Luke Cage is an AWESOME superhero. A guy who doesn't have great expectations of saving the world, just his own backyard. The characters are great. Those who'd bag it are clearly not watching the full season to get the nuances and machinations of the personalities created by the writers, directors, and actors.No spoilers here, but watch the whole season. I'd likely have actually given this an 8/10 but I feel like it needs a little more to counter the ratings people with a different agenda seem to be giving it. It's a great show that only got better with Season 2!",23 June 2018," 10s across the board

568,ElessarAndurilS,"The Netflix/Marvel partnership just keeps on kicking out great shows and Luke Cage doesn't let down a bit. I'm disappointed they can't put out a season a year like normal shows, but the quality is excellent helping offset some of the pain. I can understand they are ramping up, but 3 years between the first season of Jessica Jones and the second? Maybe they bit off to much? Only problem with that statement is that the quality is just staying at the 9/10 level which would stand against that statement. Luke Cage does a good job of tying in loose references to Jessica Jones and the other Marvel/Netflix shows. Like having the doc show up in a more substantial role. Good Ending leaving me expecting a season 2 that will raise the bar even higher. Keep it up!!!",6 October 2016," Netflix and Marvel knock another out of the park

569,wgeddings,"The other Marvel on Netflix shows have been okay to sometimes good but tended to drag. The ""superhero"" aspect tended to be downplayed sometimes and it got into more of a drama series with someone who just happened to have superpowers. I always enjoyed the Luke Cage comic books although some of the more recent changes (in cartoons) have not been to my liking so I had low expectations for this NetFlix series. WOW was I surprised! THIS was the Luke Cage I remembered reading about in the comic! His superpowers were no big deal to him and he did not whine about being different. He has virtually impenetrable skin and super strength but they do not define him nor make him feel better or worse about himself. I hate superhero shows where the character is conflicted because he has all this power or ability and wishes to be ""normal"". Luke is still just Luke. He has powers, he is an escaped criminal, he has many aspects but he is still who he is. The character development for him is well told and engaging. Mike Colter is from Columbia SC so that was good to see. I wanted Terry Crews for Luke Cage but now I cannot imagine anyone being better than Mike Colter. I thought his acting was great and the changing look (sometimes with more hair or beard) were well played. He really did terrific and muscled just the right amount. The other characters were also great. Mariah was detestable in the right way. Diamondback was great. Cottonmouth (although not super powered which is my only complaint about him) was wonderful. My favorite was Shades though so I hope we will see him, and that actor, again. His eyes and general demeanor were just perfect. Rosairo Dawson's Claire really fit well into the story and I liked her better that her prior appearances.Some people do not like the show because of ""black power"" stuff but it is important to remember that the character was created during the blaxtoyplation phase of Hollywood so it was designed to be that way. I am not black but I felt it hit the right notes to stay true to the origins (taking place in Harlem and so forth) while also being relevant. I cannot say enough good things about this series and I cannot wait for another season or for Luke to turn up on other shows. My biggest complaint is the they only showed Luke once in his iconic yellow shirt, blue pants and chain but at least they showed it (with great explanation of why he was wearing them). At least a lot of people referred to him as Power Man (much more than I was expecting) and he kept saying his catchphrase ""Sweet Christmas"".",11 October 2016," Incredibly good - Definitely do not miss

Then there is a beautiful NY 60ties ambiance which adds even more warmth to the show.And there is THE MUSIC, THE MUSIC. I cannot get over all (the independent) musical numbers - Jazz, Blues, RnB that they play in the clubs. It is just outstanding. This small detail really takes the show to a whole other level for me.

573,generationofswine,"Well, honestly, I was hoping for a Luke Cage TV show since I saw the first preview of ""Marvel Agents of SHIELD"" And I will be even more honest, when they gave it to me I was hoping for Iron Fist and then Hoping for Heroes for Hire.To me Cage and Iron Fist and Wing and Knight are icons of the 1970s Marvel era...which I was not alive for, but thank God for Marvel Essentials.Iron Fist was like Marvel's Bruce Lee and Cage, he was Marvel's Shaft. Together they were just the coolest thing to read.You have to thank Marvel for recognizing that, thank Netflicks for giving it to us.Cage could never make it on the Silver Screen on his own, not now that its not the 70s any longer. Real comic book nerds my age are few in number and, well, even then I was an Essentials reader.BUT, he could make it online and what you have here is the hands down coolest hero in the Marvel universe doing his thing and waiting for the salt and pepper team-up with the character that is the farthest thing from street smart.We know it is coming and, we can't wait.

574,filmnoirthebest,"I found little or nothing wrong with this show! I've only seen three episodes, but I'm sold! I like the writing, and actors not so familiar faces or the usual ones we see, so hooray for that! I love how the characters are fleshed out before we go into superhero mode! I'm not into action flicks without more than explosives and fights, but interesting storytelling is very important. Love the whole cast, the detective chick get cool points for playing basketball, I love that aspect added to her character! Luke Cage is just what we need right about now with so much going on in the world, in terms of moral decay and violence! Great Job!",5 October 2016," A Great Show!

In a world of white faced Super Hero's emerges a HeMan of the people who just so happens to be Black and well spoken and honest and strong. Needless to say it's such a breath of fresh air that Marvel got this right -- Excellent casting, excellent villains, and a story line that parallels the comic version without breaking the chain(pardon the pun). Updated and ready for the 21st century audience this little gem of a series will knock your socks off! Once I started to watch the show I was hooked and sucked up episodes like liquid candy.P.S. if they made the women in this any hotter I'd probably suffer a stroke!

578,marto_dd,"Last year I was really pleased with Item 47. It was funny, smart, had a nice dialog and likable characters. I hoped Agent Carter would be at least that good.Well, it was actually much, MUCH better. While Item 47 was generally enjoyable, Agent Carter is really touching. It brings some serious questions without loosing its lighter tone.Hayley Atwell is phenomenal as Peggy Carter. Atwell just has it all - the emotional depth, the attractive looks, the cool moves - the whole package. She's playing the character with so much love, it's an absolute pleasure to watch her. Peggy is forced to live in a world of injustice and double standards. Her struggle to keep it together is wonderfully done here.This short film feels like a mini-episode of Alias and that's one of the biggest compliments I could ever say about anything.My only complain about it is that it's not a full-length feature film. Marvel fans deserve a female-lead full-length feature film. Peggy deserves her own full-length feature film. Atwell deserves full-length feature film.

This is a short movie that comes with the Blu ray edition of Iron Man 3.The plot for this film is simple but works of Peggy as we see her grow as far as a character goesNow the writing for this one is very good and so fun one-liners. The music in the film is really well done it gives you that feel of danger, decision, and surprise for a short film.The acting very well done with the best performance going to Hayley who is just right for the role of Agent Carter she just knows how to make the character The plot for this short film is smart, clever and goes to show the best man for the job is a woman and there is turns of unexpected you don't see coming.The film just knows how to hold your attention which is why I suggest giving this one a tryI give Marvel One Shot: Agent Carter an 10 out of 10",5 April 2016," My favorite Marvel One Shot film

580,utsavbansal93,"I give it a deserving 9.5*Ben Kingsley returns in this wonderful One-Shot, and he doesn't disappoint. The 'twist' in Iron Man 3 had the fandom divided, some people liking Trevor Slattery and the others hating him, but this One-Shot gives the answer to how the hate was misdirected after all. Before I go let me tell you this wasn't a work of appeasement, or Marvel tracking back their footsteps, though they tease it a little when Trevor says, ""Once an actor plays a part for too long he becomes the character..."", or something. On the contrary the One-Shot establishes the Ten-Rings connection from the first Iron Man and shows that there is yet more depth to uncover in Iron Man's own side story. TLDR: It's an awesome ride for MCU and Iron Man movie fans, though if you are just a regular movie goer, chances are that you won't get what all the fuss is about.",4 February 2014," Hail the King!
